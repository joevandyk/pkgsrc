The SUSE 10.0 meta-package provides a number of components for a
SUSE-based Linux binary emulation environment.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a "meta-package"
that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is to require
dependencies so users can install this package only and have all the
other packages pulled in automatically by the pkgsrc dependency
mechanism.
