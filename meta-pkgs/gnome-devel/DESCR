GNOME is the GNU Network Object Model Environment.

The GNOME project intends to build a complete, easy-to-use desktop
environment for the user, and a powerful application framework for
the software developer.

This is a meta package for the second major version of the GNOME
project.  It provides all the utilities (not libraries) required
to build and develop software for this environment, specially
those packages downloaded from CVS repositories.
