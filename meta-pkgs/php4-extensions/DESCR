PHP 4.x is HTML-embedded scripting language.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other PHP packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the PHP stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.
