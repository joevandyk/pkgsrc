The web-server meta-package provides all the elements of a webserver,
using other components of the NetBSD packages collection.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.
