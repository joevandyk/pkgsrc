GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging
from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

This meta package installs the GTK+ toolkit together with several extra
engines and themes, which may be required to install additional third-party
themes.
