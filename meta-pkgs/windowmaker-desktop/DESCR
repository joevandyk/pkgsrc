The windowmaker-desktop meta-package provides a number of components for
a WindowMaker based environment. It basically provides the window
manager, a configuration tool, some themes and icons and several dock
applications.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.
