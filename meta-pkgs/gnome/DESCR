GNOME is the GNU Network Object Model Environment.

The GNOME project intends to build a complete, easy-to-use desktop
environment for the user, and a powerful application framework for
the software developer.

This is a meta package for the second major version of the GNOME
project.  It provides all the basic components required to get a
working desktop plus several utilities that are considered to be
part of a standard GNOME installation.
