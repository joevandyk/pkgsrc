Amateur Radio TCP/IP DX-cluster client. A DX Cluster is a means for
Amateur (Ham) Radio operators to tell each other, in realtime, about
DX stations (other interesting or rare Amateur Radio stations all over
the world). Users who are connected to a DX Cluster are capable of
announcing DX spots and related announcements, send personal talk messages,
send and receive mail messages, search and retrieve archived data, and
access data from information databases.
