# This is the first configuration file DPBOX will read
# Take care, if something is missing or misconfigured,
# DPBOX will NOT start.
#
# After reading this config file (it only defines the basic unix
# setup of the system), DPBOX will read the file system/config.box
# (and all other files in the subdirectory system/ ). Those files
# define the amateur radio settings of DPBOX. Please check them and
# set them up carefully.

# THIS FILE CANNOT BE REREAD WHILE DPBOX IS RUNNING!
# If you change any of the settings, you have to restart dpbox to
# accept the changes. The configuration data in all other files
# can be reloaded by sending a -SIGHUP to dpbox or by typing
# RELOAD in the mailbox itself.

# DPBOX can only change to this user if started as root...
