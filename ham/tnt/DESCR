About Packet Radio and TNT

Packet-Radio is a special mode used by Radio Amateurs to transfer text and
data over a radio link. Packet-Radio, as the name suggests, is packet
orientated and uses the AX.25-protocol, a special version of X.25
to fit Ham Radio needs.

The interface between the radio transceiver and terminal/PC is called
a Terminal Node Controller (TNC). It implements the AX.25 Protocol and
consists of a micro-controller, a radio modem and RS232 interface.

Special firmware such as WA8DED-Software and 'The Firmware' by NORD><LINK,
which is available for most TNC's, make use of the hostmode protocol via
the RS232-interface. The advantage of the hostmode is that it gives a
PC control over the TNC. It allows applications to implement features
which are not available in terminal mode.

TNT (TNc Terminalprogram) is a terminal program which takes advantage
of the hostmode protocol implementing features such as virtual screens
for multiple traffic channels and various interfaces to other software
packages such as tfkiss, dpbox and much more.
