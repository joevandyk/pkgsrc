7plus is an uuencoder-like file coder for use in Amateur Packet Radio
BBS S&F of binary data files. The Packet Radio protocol (AX.25) utilizes
8 bits for data transfer whereas most standard terminal programs only
use a 7 bits alogarithm. The result is that only 87.5% of the available
bandwidth is utilized.

7plus fully exploits the capacity of the network by using all 8 bits
and hence increasing data throughput. Furthermore, it uses alogarithms
which checks for data integrity, detecting, reporting and, whenever
possible, correcting data transmission errors that may have occurred due
to noise or loss of signal with minimal overheads.
