GNU Radio is a collection of software that when combined with minimal hardware,
allows the construction of radios where the actual waveforms transmitted and
received are defined by software. What this means is that it turns the digital
modulation schemes used in today's high performance wireless devices into
software problems.

This module contains the non GNU Radio specific libraries, firmware and FPGA
code for the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), a low-cost and
high-speed implementation of the GNU Radio hardware.
