Ntesla is a program to help design a Tesla Coil.  It provides a series
of design screens where you fill in proposed specifications for the
various components of the design.  It performs all the necessary
calculations for resonant frequency, capacitor size, primary taps,
etc, and helps you come up with a balanced, optimal design.  Some help
text is built-in, and there is also a reference to the tesla archives
on funet.
