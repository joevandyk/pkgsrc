The program xcircuit is a generic drawing program tailored especially
for making publication-quality renderings of circuit diagrams (hence
the name).  The output is pure PostScript, and the graphical interface
attempts to maintain as much consistency as possible between the X11
window rendering and the final printer output.

xcircuit is mouse, menu, and keyboard-driven, with the emphasis on
single-character keyboard macros.
