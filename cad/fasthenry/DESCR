FastHenry is a three-dimensional inductance extraction program.
FastHenry computes the frequency dependent self and mutual inductances
and resistances between conductors of complex shape.  The algorithm
used in FastHenry is an acceleration of the mesh formulation approach.
The linear system resulting from the mesh formulation is solved using
a generalized minimal residual algorithm with a fast multipole
algorithm to efficiently compute the iterates.
