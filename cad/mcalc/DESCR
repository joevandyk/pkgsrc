Mcalc is a JavaScript based calculator for  accurate microstrip
transmission line analysis and synthesis.

The electrical parameters may be determined from specified physical
parameters, or the physical parameters required to meet a given set of
electrical parameters may be found.

Much attention has been given to making mcalc the most accurate online
based calculator short of a full electromagnetic simulation.
