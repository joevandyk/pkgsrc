# I really want this to be post-*patch* where it makes sense, but QTDIR isn't
# available until after the wrapper phase because it depends on
# BUILDLINK_PREFIX.qt3-libs, which buildlink3 sets.  Nothing is easy.  :) The
# patches have replaced old hardcoded paths with fixed cookies @PREFIX@ and
# @QTDIR@.  The SUBST framework will replace the cookies with the proper

# Just setting BUILD_DIRS would be adequate if qcad could be built with
# "prepare all" in each module, one by one.  But qcad needs all modules to
# be prepare'd before any can be all'd, so prepare them here in a separate
# loop duplicated from do-build.  The unmodified do-build then takes care
# of the "all".  I didn't see an easier way.
