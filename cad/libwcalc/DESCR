This is the library for wcalc which contains all of the numerical
backend routines and models.

Wcalc is a tool for the analysis and synthesis of transmission
line structures and related components.  Wcalc provides the
ability to analyze the electrical parameters of a particular
structure based on the physical dimensions and material parameters.
The synthesis portion calculates the required physical parameters
to meet desired electrical specifications.  Wcalc includes several
models and places an emphasis on accuracy.  Several frontends
provide the user with several options for its use.
