  This package contains a set of utilities for gEDA (GNU Electronic
Design Automation).  Currently there are several utilities:

  * gmk_sym is a simple utility to convert comma separated
    descriptions into rectangular gschem symbols. It should be useful
    for easily creating memory, processors or connector style parts.

  * smash_megafile is a C program that will take a ViewLogic megafile
    and extract the contents into a directory of the same name, with
    one file representing each element in the library.

  * convert_sym takes ViewLogic Viewdraw schematic or symbol and
    outputs a gschem compatible file.  This utility should be
    considered a work in progress.

  * gpstoimage is a simple bourne shell script which shows how to
    take the postscript generated by gschem and convert it into an
    image (such as a gif or whatever).
