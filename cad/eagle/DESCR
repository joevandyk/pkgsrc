  The EAGLE Layout Editor is an easy to use, yet powerful tool for designing
printed circuit boards (PCBs).  The name EAGLE is an acronym, which stands for
Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor.

  The program consists of three main modules

	* Layout editor
	* Schematic editor
	* Autorouter

  which are embedded in a single user interface.  Therefore there is no need
for converting netlists between schematics and layouts.
