VIPEC is an network analyser for electrical networks. It takes a
texted based description of an electrical network, and performs a
simulation of the circuit response in the frequency domain. Output is
in the form of 2-port parameters, and can be plotted on in a grid and
Smithchart format. VIPEC supports various lumped circuit elements, as
well as elements like transmission lines and 2-port data files.
