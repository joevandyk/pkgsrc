gsmc is a GTK application that allow to do all the calculation
usually done on a Smith Chart.  It permits to make calculation
for network composed by resistor, capacitor, inductance, and
transmission line (also as stub).  Network topology is
limited to series, parallel and as trasmissive
for trasmission line. No series connection are allowed in parallel
branch, neither parallel connection in series branch.
Trasmission line can be placed as quadrupole or as a parallel or
series stub, either opened or shorted at the other end.

Calculation procedure starts with setting the initial impedance to be
matched, next network elements are added and tuned to obtain the
desidered impedance value.

The network so obtained can be saved in spice format for other analysis;
current work can be saved for succesive retrieve.

The initial (start) impedance is thought as "the load" so when
adding a trasmission line placed as a quadrupole rotation is
clockwise, going "toward generator"; generator is placed after the
last network element, as can be seen from spice output.
