Electric is a sophisticated electrical CAD system that can handle
many forms of circuit design, including:
     Custom IC layout (ASICs), Schematic drawing, Hardware description
     language specifications, Electro-mechanical hybrid layout

Electric has these CAD operations:
     Design rule checking (3 options), Electrical rule checking,
     Simulation and simulation interface (12 options), Generation (3 options),
     Compaction, Compensation, Routing (4 options), VHDL compilation,
     Silicon compilation, Network consistency checking (LVS),
     Logical Effort analysis, Project Management

Electric handles these types of design:
     MOS (6 CMOS variations, 1 nMOS variation), Bipolar and BiCMOS,
     Schematics and printed circuits, Digital filters, Temporal logic, Artwork

Electric handles these file formats:
     CIF I/O, GDS I/O, EDIF I/O, DXF I/O, SDF Input,
     SUE Input, VHDL I/O, Verilog Output, EAGLE, PADS, and ECAD Output,
     PostScript, HPGL, and QuickDraw output
