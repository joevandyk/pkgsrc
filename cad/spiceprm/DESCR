Spiceprm was written in the course of moving my engineering activities
to the Linux operating system.  My previous MSDOS spice package
permitted passing parameters to subcircuits.  The raw Berkely Spice
doesn't.   Anyone used to this feature knows the frustration of trying
to use a simulator without it.  This script is the result of my
desperation.  It translates a circuit file containing parameterized
subcircuits with math expressions into another circuit file meeting raw
spice requirements.  You then run spice on the translated output file.
