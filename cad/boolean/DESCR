The program is a viewer and editor for:
  -GDSII files, KEY files (own made extended GDSII in ascii format) and
   DAVID MANN files (flash format for mask plotting)

Features:
 -It allows to draw primitives on a chosen layer, and to manipulate them.
 -stack oriented tools allows zooming while drawing new primitives and
  editing them. This also makes it possible to draw extremely accurate.
 -primitives on the layers or/can be transparent  colors and fill patterns
  can be set on a layer basis
 -drawing order of layers can be changed
 -a hiearchy of pictures, named structures, can be handled and manipulated
 -saving as a bitmap and other formats.
 -measuring distances
 -adding user defined properties to primitives


 -boolean OR AND EXOR A-B B-A
 -positive and negative process offset
 -circle recognition in polygon and polyline data.
 -move copy delete etc.
 -transformations (scaling , rotation , moving)
 -flatten the hiearchy of the drawing
 -drivers for CNC (laser and milling machinery)
