gnetman is a program which currently supports advanced SPICE
netlisting from gschem (part of the gEDA tool suite). The
primary use so far has been for complex IC design.  Supported
features include multi-level hierarchy, instance arrays, and
buses. If you're just doing flat designs for PC boards or
smaller SPICE simulations, the usual path is to use the spice-sdb
netlister for gnetlist instead.

The long term goal of gnetman is far greater. Two projects under
consideration include a schematic generator, and a technology
mapping back-end for Icarus Verilog. Basically, gnetman is a
netlist manipulation database well suited for low-level
manipulation of netlists.
