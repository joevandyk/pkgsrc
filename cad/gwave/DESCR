Gwave is a viewer for spice-like simulator output and other analog data

Gwave can read several file formats.  It attempts to guess file formats
based on filename, and then tries all file formats until one succeeds.
These file formats are known:

CAzM transient output (*.[BNW])
HSPICE binary and ascii formats (*.tr0, *.sw0, *.ac0)
Spice2 and Spice3 "raw" output  (*.raw)
An ascii format with whitespace-separated columns and column headings,
such as that produced by ACS (Al's circuit simulator). (*.acs, *.asc, *.ascii)

The "Export Postscript" and "Export PNM" options on the main File menu
provide the rudiments of output for inclusion in other
documentation.  They and simply write out files called gwave_out.ps and
gwave_out.pnm into the current directory.  In the future, a dialog box
will allow configuring the print and export output.
