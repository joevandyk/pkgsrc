Surface Impedance Method for Interconnect Analysis.

SIMIAN is a two dimensional frequency dependent series
impedance extraction tool for inerconnects and transmission
lines using conductors of rectangular or circular cross section.

The use of the surface ribbon method (SRM) greatly enhances
the speed of computation relative to the volume filament
method (VFM).
