-XCHIPLOGO 
-
-     Xchiplogo is an X interface for chiplogo. 
-
-FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO WAIT ANY MORE
-
-     1- open the input file (which should be in the PBM    ascii, 
-     B&W format).   You can  use the input file browser.  If  you
-     do not have any input file you can 'Launch XV' to grab some-
-     thing from the screen and then save it into a file. Remember
-     that after you generate the input file using XV, you  should
-     load it in.
-     
-     2- Press the 'Generate Output'. If you do not have any spec-
-     ific name for the outpu file in mind,     xchiplogo will use 
-     'logo.mag' or 'logo.cif' instead.
-     
-     3- Your file is ready. You can have a look at it using  your
-     favorite layout editor.
-     
-     4- If you want to partially correct some of the design  rule
-     errors, use the options in the 'Partial Error Correction' to
-     reduce the number of  errors.  Note that every time that you 
-     change   the parameters,   the 'Generate Output'  should  be 
-     pressed to generate the  new layout.
-
-AND THE REST OF THE STORY
-
-     Xchiplogo reads an ascii bitmap file, and converts it into a  
-     magic  or cif file. It is a handy program for creating logos 
-     of text or graphics for  putting  on  VLSI  chips.   At  the
-     moment  it  accepts  the  B&W dithered format of XV as the 
-     input. It has got quite a few options for resizing and  get-
-     ting rid of many design rule errors that can be found in the
-     bitmap file. It has  a smoothing, before and after an  error
-     correction  step. The error correction step is pretty simple
-     ,don't expect miracles, but it works quite  fine  and  spe- 
-     cially for text gives a reasonable output.  
-
-     I wrote this program when I saw my friends sitting for hours
-     to  write  their name;  in a font that we call mikhi in per-
-     sian 'nail-font'.  I have also seen  many  comercial  layout
-     editors  which  have  tried  to implement a simple text-logo
-     generation, which all  are very limited and inflexible. So I
-     started  Xchiplogo. The input to chiplogo is ascii bitmap.It
-     really doesn't matter what program has generated the bitmap,
-     as  long as there are two digits at the begining of the file
-     which tell the size of the bitmap in pixels,  and  then  the
-     sequence of the ones and zeros.
- 
-     Although the output files may seem a bit  big,  if  you  use
-     magic after generating the file, magic reduces the size by a
-     factor of more than 10!!!.   It is simply because each black
-     pixel  in  the  input file becomes a box in the output magic
-     file. Magic merges the boxes  so that they  conform  to  its
-     corner   stitch   style.  I  have found magic to be the best
-     package for editing the design rule errors of the  generated
-     layouts.   With other layout editors you may lose your pati-
-     ence.
- 
-OPTIONS, KEYS, and PARAMETERS
-
-      CIF layer name
-        The cif layer that is  to  be  used  for  the  logo.  The
-        default is CPG (poly).
-
-      Micron/Lambda
-	This parameter tells the scaling factor for a CIF format.
-	For a 2 micron technology it is 50 (the default). For a 
-	0.8 micron it should be set to 20, and so on.
- 
-      Magic layer name
-        The magic layer name that is to be used for the logo. The
-        default is poly.
- 
-      Technology name
-        This option is used with magic option and is  to  specify
-        the technology.
- 
-      Minimum width
-        The minimum width of the layer. This value is used in all
-        the  error  correction  and  smoothing  operations.   The
-        default is 2.
- 
-      Minimum spacing
-        The minimum space of the layer. This value is used in all
-        the  error  correction  and  smoothing  operations.   The
-        default is 2.
- 
-      Partial error correction
-        This switch toggles the error  detection  and  correction
-        stage.  The default is off. When it is turned on the rel-
- 	evant parameters will be shown in the window.
- 
-      Scale factor
-        The scaling factor, scales the layout by the this factor.
- 
-      Threshold before
-        This option turns on the smoothing operation before error
-        correction  stage.  The  threshold_before  is used as the
-        threshold value used  after  the  smoothing.  It  can  be
-        between  0 to 16. The smoothing function at the moment is
-        a simple triangular function, and acts over a  neighbour-
-        hood of minimum_width.
- 
-      Threshold after
-        This option turns on the smoothing operation  before  the
-        error  correction  stage.  The threshold_after is used as
-        the threshold value used after the smoothing. It  can  be
-        between  0 to 16. The smoothing function at the moment is
-        a simple triangular function, and acts over a  neighbour-
-        hood of minimum_width
-
-      Launch XV (Shortkey CTRL-V)
-	This  button  launches the XV  for grabbing  a  piece  of 
-	graphics.
-
-      Help  (Shortkey CTRL-H)
-	To   bring up this  window.  In this window if  you press 
-	the botton on the bottok saying 'OK, Get rid of this window' 
-	the window will disappear.
- 
-     Generate output (CTRL-G)
- 	After you have loaded an input file, press this button to 
-	generate the layout. If no input file is given, or if the
-	specified input does not  exist it will  warn you of this
-	problem. But if the output file does not exist, depending
-	on the output format selected (magic or cif) it will save
-	the layout in a default file 'logo.mag' or 'logo.cif'.
-     
-     Input File (CTRL-I)
-	You   should  specify  the  input file name. You can also 
-	browse by  pressing the  browse button next to this input 
-	field.
- 
-     Output File (CTRL-O)
-	You should  specify the  output file  name.  You can also 
-	browse	by pressing the browse button next to this  input 
-	field.
-
-     Quite (CTRL-Q)
-        You guess what this one does!!
-
-     About (CTRL-A)
-        Just the author info.
- 
-NOTE
-     	The format of the input file  SHOULD be  'PBM (ascii)-B&W 
-	Dithered'. With other formats xchiplogo will hang.
