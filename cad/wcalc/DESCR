Wcalc is a transmission line analysis and synthesis tool.  Several
structures including air core solenoid inductors, coaxial cable,
single and coupled microstrip, stripline, and metal-insulator-
semiconductor microstrip are included.

Wcalc can analyze the electrical parameters for a given physical
description of the structure or synthesize the required dimensions
to meet certain desired electrical characteristics.

Wcalc provides several different frontends for accessing the numeric
engine.  Currently, there is a GTK based standalone graphical
user interface, a common gateway interface (CGI) for web access,
Scilab, Octave, and Matlab interfaces for maximum flexibility within
a scientific programming environment, and a standard input/output
(stdio) interface which allows a simple interface to other 3rd
party tools which can communicate via a pipe.

The different frontends are installed as different packages for
flexibility in deployment.
