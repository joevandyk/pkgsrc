Xquote is a WWW ticker symbol quote retrieval program for UNIX systems
using the X Window System. Xquote requires Motif 1.2 or later and XPM.

Xquote retrieves quotes from a number of net sources. It takes a ticker
symbol (stock, mutual fund, currency) and displays info in a table or
ticker tape. The table data displayed is selectable, and includes price,
date, change, volume, yield, 52 week high/low, day high/low, P/E,
dividend, full name, basically whatever can be reliably retrieved from
multiple sources.
