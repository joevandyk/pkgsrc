This is the LibOFX library. It is a parser and an API designed to
allow applications to very easily support OFX command responses,
usually provided by financial institutions for statement downloads.
To my knowledge, it is the first working OpenSource implementation
of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on the client
side.
