TCLTicker is a simple stock tickertape, using HTTP requests to fetch
quotes.  It includes 'mailquote', which can email quotes.  TclTicker
uses a plug-in architecture for quote services.  Currently, quote
service modules are written for Yahoo (one for U.S.  markets, another
for Euro markets) and Quote.com.  User configuration includes tuning
the ticker scroll rate and data refresh dates, fonts, http proxy, smtp
host, rounding, always on top, and ticker symbol lists.
