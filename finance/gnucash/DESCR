GnuCash is a personal finance manager. A check-book like register
GUI allows you to enter and track bank accounts, stocks, income
and even currency trades. A full set of reports allow you to see
the state of your finances. The interface is designed to be simple
and easy to use, but is backed with double-entry accounting principles
to ensure balanced books.  Features include:

  - An easy-to-use interface.  If you can use the register in the
    back of your checkbook, you can use GnuCash.  Type directly
    into the register, tab between fields, and use quick-fill to
    automatically complete the transaction.  The interface is
    customizable from within the application itself (no editing
    config files :) )
