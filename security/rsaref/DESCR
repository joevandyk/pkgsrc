RSAREF is a free, portable software developer's library of popular
encryption and authentication algorithms. The name "RSAREF" means
"RSA reference." RSA Laboratories intends RSAREF to serve as a free,
educational reference implementation of modern public- and secret-key
cryptography.

RSAREF 2.0 supports the following algorithms:

     o    RSA encryption and key generation, as defined by RSA
          Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

     o    MD2 and MD5 message digests

     o    DES (Data Encryption Standard) in cipher-block chaining mode

     o    Diffie-Hellman key agreement

     o    DESX, RSA Data Security's efficient, secure DES enhancement

     o    Triple-DES, for added security with three DES operations
