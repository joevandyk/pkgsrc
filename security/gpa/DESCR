The GNU Privacy Assistant is a graphical user interface for the GNU
Privacy Guard (GnuPG).  GnuPG is a system that provides you with
privacy by encrypting emails or other documents and with
authentication of received files by signature management.

GPA utilizes the GIMP Tool Kit (GTK) and compiles for various
platforms.

GPA is still work in progress, so don't expect that everything works
and be careful when using production quality secret keys.
