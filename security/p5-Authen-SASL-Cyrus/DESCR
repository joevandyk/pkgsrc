SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several
network protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation
framework that all protocols should be able to share.

The XS framework makes calls into the existing libsasl.so
shared library to perform SASL client connection functionality,
including loading existing shared library mechanisms.

Authen::SASL::Cyrus implements XS SASL Authentication.
