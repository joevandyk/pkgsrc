GNOME Keyring Manager is an application that manages user keyrings.
The default window shows 'default' keyrings with its items and allows
to remove, add and edit them.  It also lets you edit your secrets and
copy them using drag and drop.  The Manager window allows to lock/unlock,
create and open other keyrings.  At last, items can be moved between
different keyrings.
