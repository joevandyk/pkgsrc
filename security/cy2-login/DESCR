SASL is a method for adding authentication support to connection-based
protocols.  To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection
of subsequent protocol interactions.  If its use is negotiated, a security
layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection.

This is the Cyrus SASL plugin that implements the LOGIN authentication
mechanism.  It's recommended that it only be used if absolutely necessary
since it is not a secure authentication scheme.
