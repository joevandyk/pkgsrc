Mhash:

Mhash is an open source (under GNU Lesser GPL) library which provides
a uniform interface to a large number of hash algorithms. These
algorithms can be used to compute checksums, message digests, and
other signatures. The HMAC support implements the basics for message
authentication, following RFC 2104. In the later versions some key
generation algorithms, which use hash algorithms, have been added.
The manpage for mhash is mhash.3.html. At the time of writing this,
the library supports the algorithms: SHA1, GOST, HAVAL, MD5,
RIPEMD160, TIGER, and CRC32 checksums.
