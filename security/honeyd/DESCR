Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.
The hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their
personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain
operating systems. Honeyd enables a single host to claim multiple
addresses - I have tested up to 65536 - on a LAN for network
simulation. Honeyd improves cyber security by providing mechanisms
for threat detection and assessment. It also deters adversaries by
hiding real systems in the middle of virtual systems.
