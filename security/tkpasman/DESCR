TkPasMan is a simple program that lets you store usernames and passwords
you collect during access to forums, mailing lists, and other websites.
It is inspired in gpasman, but it has more paste possibilities. You can,
for example, paste the username at first and then password, using two
mouse clicks.

Passwords can be stored in a secure file, using OpenSSL to encrypt it.
