Ruby/Password is a suite of password handling methods for Ruby.  It
supports the manual entry of passwords from the keyboard in both
buffered and unbuffered modes, password strength checking, random
password generation, phonemic password generation (for easy
memorization by human-beings) and the encryption of passwords.
