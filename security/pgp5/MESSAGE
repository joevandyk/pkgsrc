There are a number of large changes from the 2.6.2 distribution.  Most
notable is that the command line has changed substantially.  See
the pgp5(1) man page for a discussion of how to use the new command
line.

Also, to allow easy interoperation with older versions on the same
system, a number of filename changes have been made:

	~/.pgp/pubring.pgp	is now ~/.pgp/pubring.pkr
	~/.pgp/secring.pgp	is now ~/.pgp/secring.skr
	~/.pgp/config.txt	is now ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg
	~/.pgp/language.txt	is now ~/.pgp/language50.txt

The application will NOT automatically migrate these files for you; if
you wish to retain your existing keyrings and configuration files, you
should copy them yourself.  Note that copying language.txt to
language50.txt is a decidedly bad idea.  Also note that language50.txt
is entirely optional; US English is the only language it contains at
this time.
