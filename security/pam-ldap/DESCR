  The pam_ldap module provides the means for workstations to authenticate
against LDAP directories, and to change their passwords in the directory.
Key Benefits are:

 * Uses the Pluggable Authentication Module API defined in OSF DCE RFC 86.0.
 * Can utilize transport layer security (such as SSL or TLS) to encrypt
   transactions between the workstation and the LDAP server and provide
   strongly authenticated sign-on.
 * Shares configuration information with nss_ldap module
 * Supports ypldapd locator for finding LDAP servers
 * Supports Netscape Directory Server's password policies and directory-based
   access authorization.
