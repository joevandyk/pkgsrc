Small DES (Data Encryption Standard) standalone program.
If you have openssl installed, you probably don't need this.
However, for reverse compatibility with your previously
encrypted data or with the SunOS des, you might want to keep
this one around.  Plus, it compiles easily on PCs with djgpp.
I've renamed all the installed files to be libdes, libdes.h,
etc., to avoid conflicts with other packages.
