Purpose: To use intrusion fingerprints to track down compromised hosts.
Scope:   TCP/UDP/ICMP (No fragmentation reassembly)
Specs:   Program can create somewhat arbitrary UDP/ICMP/TCP packets/streams
         and send them to a range of hosts.  It also listens promiscuously
         for predefined intrusion "fingerprints".
