Secure Shell is a program to log into another computer over a
network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files
from one machine to another.  It provides strong authentication
and secure communications over insecure channels.  It is intended
as a replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist.

The programs in this package implement version 2 of the Secure Shell
protocol.
