Mcrypt:

mcrypt is intended to be a replacement of the old unix crypt(1)
under the GNU General Public License. Unix Crypt(1) was a popular(?)
file encryption program in unix boxes. It was based on the enigma
encryption algorithm but it was considerable trivialized. Since
this was not adequate, even for individual privacy needs, I decided
to create a similar program using some modern block encryption
algorithms. Mcrypt also has a compatibility mode with unix crypt(1)
and with solaris des(1). It supports all the algorithms and modes
found in libmcrypt and it is very extendable. At the time writing
this, it supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES,
3-WAY, SAFER, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS, IDEA, RIJNDAEL, SERPENT,
CAST, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block algorithms are implemented in modes:
CFB, CBC, ECB, OFB (8 bit and n bit, where n is the size of the
algorithm's block length). For a brief description of the algorithms
and the modes look at the mcrypt manpage (this may be out of date).
In mcrypt it is on the user to decide which algorithm he considers
best for encrypting his data.
