The pam_pwauth_suid authentication module uses a setuid program
to verify a password against the encrypted password in the
database used by the system. This way, an unprivileged user can
verify his own passsword stored in a shadow password database.
There might be some risk that the communication between the
invoking program and the setuid program is logged, or for abuse
for dictionary attacks.
