The Nessus Security Scanner performs its security checks by
launching external pieces of code called 'plugins'.
One plugin is in charge of one security check against one
host.

There are, at this time, two languages to write security checks :
NASL (the Nessus Attack Scripting Language) and C.
NASL should be prefered as it makes plugins which are easily
portable and shareable. C plugins should be avoided, except when
NASL proves to not be powerful enough.
