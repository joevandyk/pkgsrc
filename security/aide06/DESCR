It creates a database from the regular expression rules that it finds
from the config file.  Once this database is initialized it can be
used to verify the integrity of the files.  It has several message
digest algorithms (md5,sha1,rmd160,tiger,haval,etc.) that are used to
check the integrity of the file.  More algorithms can be added with
relative ease.  All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
for inconsistencies.  It can read databases from older or newer
versions.  See the manual pages within the distribution for further
info.  There is also a beginning of a manual at
