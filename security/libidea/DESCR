  This is the IDEA library of the SSLeay project.

  IDEA is a block cipher invented by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in 1991.
A block cipher is an encryption algorithm that encrypts the data in blocks.
IDEA has a block size of 64 bits, and a keylength of 128 bits. IDEA is a
symmetrical algorithm, which means that the same key is used both for
encryption and for decryption.
