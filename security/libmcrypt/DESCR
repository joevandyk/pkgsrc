Libmcrypt:

libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and
modes found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it
seems to work pretty good.  Unlike most encryption libraries
libmcrypt does not have everything (random number generators,
hashes, hmac implementation, key exchange, public key encryption
etc.).  Libmcrypt only implements an interface to access block and
stream encryption algorithms. Its purpose was to assist in the
development of mcrypt by providing a uniform interface to access
several different encryption algorithms, so that the main program
is independent of the encryption algorithms and the modes used.

Libmcrypt supports the algorithms:
BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES, 3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128,
SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS, IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128 (AES),
RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, CAST-128 (known as CAST5),
CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block algorithms can be used in: CBC,
ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit, where n is the size of the
algorithm's block length).
