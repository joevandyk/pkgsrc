Certificate Service Provider is a perl wrapper around openssl that allows you
to run multiple simple certificate authorities (CAs).  CSP is designed to be
simple (almost to a fault) and is ideally suited to small PKIs (< 1000
entities) where security is paramount.  CSP is meant to be run on isolated,
offline computers while still allowing CRLs and certificate repositories to be
easily published.
