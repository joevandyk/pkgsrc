The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working
SSH implementation by the means of a library. The complete control of the
client is made by the programmer.

With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a
secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure
FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without
third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).
