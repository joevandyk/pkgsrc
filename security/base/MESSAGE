You will need to make BASE accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you will need to
add the following line to your httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/base.conf

to make BASE accessible through:

	http://localhost/base/

You will need to customise ${BASE_DIR}/base_conf.php before
BASE will work.  This includes setting up database access.
