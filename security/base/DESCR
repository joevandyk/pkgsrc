The Basic Analysis and Security Engine (BASE) is a PHP-based analysis
engine to search and process a database of security events generated by
various IDSes, firewalls, and network monitoring tools.  The features currently
include:

 o Query-builder and search interface for finding alerts matching
   on alert meta information (e.g. signature, detection time) as well as
   the underlying network evidence (e.g. source/destination address, ports,
   payload, or flags).

 o Packet viewer (decoder) will graphically display the layer-3 and
   layer-4 packet information of logged alerts

 o Alert management by providing constructs to logically group alerts
   to create incidents (alert groups), deleting the handled alerts or
   false positives, exporting to email for collaboration, or archiving of
   alerts to transfer them between alert databases.

 o Chart and statistic generation based on time, sensor, signature, protocol,
   IP address, TCP/UDP ports, or classification
