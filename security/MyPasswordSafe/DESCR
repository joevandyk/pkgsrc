MyPasswordSafe is a straight-forward, easy-to-use password manager
that maintains compatibility with Password Safe files.  MyPasswordSafe
has the following features:
  * Safes are encrypted when they are stored to disk.
  * Passwords never have to be seen, because they are copied to
    the clipboard
  * Random passwords can be generated.
  * Window size, position, and column widths are remembered.
  * Passwords remain encrypted until they need to be decrypted at
    the dialog and file levels.
  * A safe can be made active so it will always be opened when
    MyPasswordSafe starts.
  * Supports Unicode in the safes
  * Languages supported: English and French
