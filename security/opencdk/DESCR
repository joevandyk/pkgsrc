OpenCDK (Open Crypto Development Kit) provides basic parts of the OpenPGP
message format.  The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available
OpenPGP version.  There will be no real support for key management (sign,
revoke, alter preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentary
available.  The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP packets and
to use basic operations.  For example to encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify
and packet routines.
