SASL is a method for adding authentication support to connection-based
protocols.  To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection
of subsequent protocol interactions.  If its use is negotiated, a security
layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection.

This is the Cyrus SASL API implentation. It can be used on the client or
server side to provide authentication. See RFC 2222 for more information.
