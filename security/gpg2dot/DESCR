This simple perl script takes the output of gpg --list-keys --verbose,
which lists all the keys in your public key ring, along with all
their signatures, and converts it to a di-graph in "dot" language
form.

The graphviz package can turn the description into a graph you can
look at to see who has signed whose key, or how far it is from your
key to someone in Reykjavik, etc.
