You may wish to have the vulnerabilities file downloaded daily so that
it remains current.  This may be done by adding an appropriate entry
to the root users crontab(5) entry.  For example the entry

# download vulnerabilities file
0 3 * * * ${PREFIX}/sbin/download-vulnerability-list >/dev/null 2>&1

will update the vulnerability list every day at 3AM. You may wish to do
this more often than once a day.

In addition, you may wish to run the package audit from the daily
security script.  This may be accomplished by adding the following
lines to /etc/periodic/security/NNN.audit-packages, where NNN is a
number specifying the order of execution.

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/audit-packages ]; then
        ${PREFIX}/sbin/audit-packages
fi
