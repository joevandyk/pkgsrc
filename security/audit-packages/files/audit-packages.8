.Sh NAME
.Nm audit-packages ,
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
.Nd show vulnerabilities in installed packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
.Op Fl p Ar package
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program compares the installed packages with the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file and reports any known security issues to standard output.
This output contains the name and version of the package, the
type of vulnerability, and an URL for further information for each
vulnerable package.
.Pp
The following flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl d
.Nm
will attempt to download the vulnerabilities
file before scanning
the installed packages for vulnerabilities.
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Use package database directory
.Ar pkg_dbdir .
.It Fl p Ar package
Check only the package
.Ar package
for vulnerabilities.
.It Fl v
Set verbose mode.
.Nm
will warn when the vulnerabilities file is more than a week old.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
program downloads this file from
.Pa ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles/pkg-vulnerabilities
using
.Xr @FETCH_CMD_SHORT@ 1 .
This vulnerabilities file documents all known security issues in
pkgsrc packages and is kept up-to-date by the
.Nx
pkgsrc-security team.
.Pp
Each line lists the package and vulnerable versions, the type of exploit,
and an Internet address for further information:
.Bl -item
.It
.Aq package pattern
.Aq type
.Aq url
.El
.Pp
The type of exploit can be any text, although
some common types of exploits listed are:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent

cross-site-html
.It
cross-site-scripting
.It
denial-of-service

.Pp
By default, the vulnerabilities file is stored in the
@PKGVULNDIR@
directory.
This can be changed by defining the environment variable
.Ev PKGVULNDIR
to the directory containing the vulnerabilities file.
.Pp
If a URL is specified in
.Ev IGNORE_URLS
then all entries listed in
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
that match that URL will not be reported when
.Pa audit-packages
is run.
Running
.Nm Fl v
will display the details of all entries skipped if
.Ev IGNORE_URLS
is set.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std audit-packages
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
These variables can also be defined in the
@PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/audit-packages.conf
file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width PKGVULNDIR
.It Ev PKGVULNDIR
Specifies the directory containing the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file.
.It Ev FETCH_ARGS
Specifies optional arguments for the ftp client.
.It Ev FETCH_PROTO
Specifies the protocol to use when fetching the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file.
Currently supports only http and ftp.
The default is ftp.
.It Ev IGNORE_URLS
A list of vulnerability URLs to be ignored.
This allows for ignoring certain URLs that are attached to a
vulnerability.
.El
.Sh FILES
@PKGVULNDIR@/pkg-vulnerabilities
.Pp
@PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/audit-packages.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
command can be run via
.Xr cron 8
to update the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file daily.
And
.Nm
can be run via
.Xr cron 8
(or with
.Nx Ap s
.Pa /etc/security.local
daily security script).
.Pp
The
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
command can be forced to use IPv4 with the following setting in
@PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/audit-packages.conf :
.Pp
export FETCH_ARGS="-4"
.Pp
The
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
command can be forced to use http to download the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file with the following setting in
@PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/audit-packages.conf :
.Pp
export FETCH_PROTO="http"
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The following errors can occur:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Checksum mismatch
The vulnerabilities file is corrupted.
Run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
.It Missing vulnerabilities file
The vulnerabilities file could not be found.
Run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
.It \&No checksum algorithm found
The vulnerabilities file is too old or incomplete.
Run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
.It \&No checksum found
The vulnerabilities file is too old or incomplete.
Run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
.It \&No file format version found
The vulnerabilities file is too old or incomplete.
Run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
.It Unsupported file format version
The vulnerabilities file is too old or too new.
If it's too old, run
.Nm download-vulnerability-list .
If it's too new, update the
.Pa security/audit-packages
package.
.It Installed pkg_info too old
.Nm
requires a newer version of
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
Update the
.Pa pkgtools/pkg_install
package.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
and
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
commands were originally implemented and added to

pkgsrc by
.An Alistair Crooks
on September 19, 2000.
The original idea came from Roland Dowdeswell and Bill Sommerfeld.
