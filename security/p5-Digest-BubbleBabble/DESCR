The Perl module Digest::BubbleBabble can be used to create a fingerprint of
a MD5 or SHA-1 digest in "bubble babble" format. Bubble babble is a method
of representing a message digest as a string of "real" words, to make the
fingerprint easier to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words,
but they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
