Crypt::GeneratePassword generates random passwords that are (more
or less) pronounceable. Unlike Crypt::RandPasswd, it doesn't use
the FIPS-181 NIST standard, which is proven to be insecure. It does
use a similar interface, so it should be a drop-in replacement in
most cases.

If you want to use passwords from a different language than english,
you can use one of the packaged alternate unit tables or generate
your own.
