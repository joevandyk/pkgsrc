Hackbot is a vulnerability scanner that started as a joke at first, but now
it has become a serious project. Hackbot scans over 300 CGI's, scans for
banners of several services, does unicode checks, checks for open relays,
outsmarts Cisco PIX MailGuard, can do ripe checkup, spamcop db checkup, X
connect test and lots more.
