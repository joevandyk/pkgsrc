One-time cipher based back door program for executing emergency
commands.

Secure Back Door(SBD) is an alternative to leaving SSH open all the
time.  It is based on a secure one-time keypad method, that insures
maximum security.  Since SBD is very small, it is less likely to have
security exploits, as compared to SSH.  Therefore, you could leave an
important computer up and running with just sbdd running in the
background, and if an emergency came about, you could simple execute a
command to bring ssh up, then work on the computer as regular.  It
would be as simple as doing ./sbd domain.com "/etc/init.d/sshd start",
and with the proper key file set, the remote computer would have ssh
up and running shortly.
