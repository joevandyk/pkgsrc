GPass is a simple GNOME application that lets you manage a collection
of passwords.  The password collection is stored in an encrypted file,
protected by a master-password.

Features include:
* Clean and easy-to-use user interface.
* Quick-search facility.
* Username and password may easily be copied to the clipboard.
* Encryption is done using the OpenSSL cryptographic library.
* The built-in password generator helps you generate secure passwords.
