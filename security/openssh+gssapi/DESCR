OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to external libraries), all
known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced and many other
clean-ups. More information about SSH itself can be found in the file
README.Ylonen. OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song.

This package adds enhanced support for GSSAPI, provided by sxw.org.uk.
