                           *===* NOTICE *===*

If you have existing config files for OpenSSH located at /etc/ssh.conf
and /etc/sshd.conf, then you will have to copy them:

	/etc/ssh.conf  --> ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/ssh_config
	/etc/sshd.conf --> ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sshd_config

The `${OPENSSH_USER}' user and `${OPENSSH_GROUP}' group used for
privilege separation have been created if they did not already exist.
For security reasons, UsePrivilegeSeparation has to be yes
(the default value).
