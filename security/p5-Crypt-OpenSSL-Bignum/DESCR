Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum provides access to OpenSSL multi-precision integer
arithmetic libraries.  Presently, many though not all of the arithmetic
operations that OpenSSL provides are exposed to perl.
In addition, this module can be used to provide access to bignum values
produced by other OpenSSL modules, such as key parameters from
Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.
