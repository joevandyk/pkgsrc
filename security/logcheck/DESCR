Logcheck helps spot problems and security violations in your logfiles
automatically and will send the results to you in e-mail.

Logcheck is part of the Abacus Project of security tools. It is a program
created to help in the processing of UNIX system logfiles generated by the
various Abacus Project tools, system daemons, Wietse Venema's TCP Wrapper
and Log Daemon packages, and the Firewall Toolkit(c) by Trusted Information
Systems Inc.(TIS). Logcheck also works very well at reporting on other
common operating system security violations and strange events.
