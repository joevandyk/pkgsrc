Mirrordir is a suite of functions in one package.  It contains the
following programs:

* pslogin:  A remote login utility and daemon that provides a secure
shell.  This can be considered as a GPL replacement to Ssh.

* copydir:  A cp equivalent which additionally copies to and from ftp
servers.  Use it to upload and download via ftp and via mirrordir's
secure daemon.  Use it as a rigorous cp to correctly reproduce
hardlinks, permissions and access times.

* mirrordir:  Mirrors filesystems over ftp or locally via a minimal
set of changes.  It is optimised for locally mirroring a device as
an alternative to RAID devices.  It duplicates file-systems in every
detail, even correctly recreating hardlinks, devices and access
times.  It works well mirroring ftp sites that don't support ls-lR
summaries.  Mirrordir can take a C script to customise the kind of
files to mirror based on their stat info, name, or other
information.

* recursdir:  Pass a C script to recursdir to recursively perform
operations on files.  This is a fast and overkill equivalent of find.
