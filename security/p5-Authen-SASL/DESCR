SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several
network protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation
framework that all protocols should be able to share.

The included plugin Authen::SASL::Perl implements several of
these protocols (DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, EXTERNAL,
LOGIN and PLAIN).
