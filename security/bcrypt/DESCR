Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted files
are portable across all supported operating systems and processors.
Passphrases must be between 8 and 56 characters and are hashed
internally to a 448 bit key. However, all characters supplied are
significant. The stronger your passphrase, the more secure your data.

In addition to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default overwrite
the original input file with random garbage three times before deleting
it in order to thwart data recovery attempts by persons who may gain
access to your computer.
