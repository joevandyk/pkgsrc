This Perl module implements DNS Resource Record types that are relevant
for DNSSEC operations. The implementation is based on: RFC 2535, RFC
2931 and  the latest draft-ietf-dnsext-delegation-signer-0.xy.txt.

The DNSSEC protocol is a moving target. Follow the IETF DNSEXT working
group if you are interested in the protocol developments.
