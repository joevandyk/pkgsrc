x11-ssh-askpass is a lightweight passphrase dialog for OpenSSH or other
open variants of SSH. In particular, x11-ssh-askpass is useful with the
Unix port of OpenSSH by Damien Miller, and Damien includes it in his RPM
packages of OpenSSH.

x11-ssh-askpass uses only the stock X11 libraries (libX11, libXt) for its
user interface. This reduces its dependencies on external libraries (such
as GNOME or Perl/Tk). See the README for further information.
