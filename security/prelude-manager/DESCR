Prelude is a hybrid IDS consisting of multiple
sensors, managers, and a display console. This
is the manager. The Manager (there can be several
in an IDS network) accepts secured connections
from sensors and saves the alerts that Sensors
emit. This package installs the manager so that
mySql is used for alert storage.
