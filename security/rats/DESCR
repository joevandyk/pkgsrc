RATS, the Rough Auditing Tool for Security, is a security auditing utility
for C and C++ code. RATS scans source code, finding potentially dangerous
function calls.
The goal of this project is not to definitively find bugs (yet).
The current goal is to provide a reasonable starting point for performing
manual security audits.
RATS is released under version 2 of the GNU Public License (GPL).
