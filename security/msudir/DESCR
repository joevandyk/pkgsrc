msudir allows enabled users to easily manage 'setuid' scripts and
binaries.  A directory containing scripts or other executables is
created inside the basedir for each destination user. Any user is
then able to invoke the script 'bar' in the directory 'fu' via
'msudir fu/bar'. The script will be run under the uid and primary
gid of the destination user. Some effort is taken to sanitise the
arguments and environment, but msudir should not be used without
an understanding of the security implication.
