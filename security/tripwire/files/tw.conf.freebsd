# tripwire.config
# Generic version for NetBSD
#  Will need editing...see comments below
#
# This file contains a list of files and directories that System 
# Preener will scan.  Information collected from these files will be 
# stored in the tripwire.database file.
#
# Format: 			[!|=] entry [ignore-flags]
#
# where:	 '!' signifies the entry is to be pruned (inclusive) from
#				the list of files to be scanned.
#		 '=' signifies the entry is to be added, but if it is
#				a directory, then all its contents are pruned
#				(useful for /tmp).
#
# where:	entry is the absolute pathname of a file or a directory
#
# where ignore-flags are in the format:
#		[template][ [+|-][pinugsam12] ... ]
#
# 	- :  ignore the following atributes
#	+ :  do not ignore the following attributes
#
#	p :  permission and file mode bits 	a: access timestamp
#	i :  inode number			m: modification timestamp
#	n :  number of links (ref count)	c: inode creation timestamp
#	u :  user id of owner			1: signature 1
#	g :  group id of owner			2: signature 2
#	s :  size of file
#
#
# Ex:   The following entry will scan all the files in /etc, and report
#	any changes in mode bits, inode number, reference count, uid,
#	gid, modification and creation timestamp, and the signatures.
#	However, it will ignore any changes in the access timestamp.
#
#	/etc	+pinugsm12-a
#
# The following templates have been pre-defined to make these long ignore
# mask descriptions unecessary.
#
# Templates: 	(default)	R :  [R]ead-only (+pinugsm12-a)
#				L :  [L]og file (+pinug-sam12)
#				N :  ignore [N]othing (+pinusgsamc12)
#				E :  ignore [E]verything (-pinusgsamc12)
#
# By default, Tripwire uses the R template -- it ignores
# only the access timestamp.
#
# You can use templates with modifiers, like:
#	Ex:  /etc/lp	E+ug
#
#	Example configuration file:
#		/etc		R	# all system files
#		!/etc/lp	R	# ...but not those logs
#		=/tmp		N	# just the directory, not its files
#
# Note the difference between pruning (via "!") and ignoring everything
# (via "E" template):  Ignoring everything in a directory still monitors
# for added and deleted files.  Pruning a directory will prevent Tripwire
# from even looking in the specified directory.
#
#
# Tripwire running slowly?  Modify your tripwire.config entries to
# ignore the (signature 2) attribute when this computationally-exorbitant 
# protection is not needed.  (See README and design document for further
# details.)
