SRP stands for the Secure Remote Password protocol, and it represents
a new mechanism for performing secure password-based authentication
and key exchange over any type of network. SRP offers both security
and convenience improvements over authentication techniques currently
in use.

This package builds the entire source tree but only installs(/packages) the
client side programs.
