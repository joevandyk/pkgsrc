This module implements Ueli Maurer's algorithm for generating large provable
primes and secure parameters for public-key cryptosystems.  The generated
primes are almost uniformly distributed over the set of primes of the
specified bitsize and expected time for generation is less than the time
required for generating a pseudo-prime of the same size with Miller-Rabin
tests.
