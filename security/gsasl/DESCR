GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network servers
(e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication from clients, and in clients to
authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL contains a library (`libgsasl'), a command line utility (`gsasl')
to access the library from the shell, and a manual. The library includes
support for the SASL framework (with authentication functions and application
data privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial support for the
CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN,
NTLM and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.
