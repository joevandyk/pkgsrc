caff is a script that helps you in keysigning.  It takes a list of
keyids on the command line, fetches them from a keyserver and calls
GnuPG so that you can sign it.  It then mails each key to all its
email addresses - only including the one UID that we send to in each
mail.

Features:
 * Easy to setup.
 * Attaches only the very UID that we send to in the mail.
 * Prunes the key from all signatures that are not self sigs and
   not done by you, thereby greatly reducing the size of mails.
 * Sends the mail encrypted if possible, will warn before sending
   unencrypted mail (sign only keys)
 * Creates proper PGP MIME messages.
 * Uses separate GNUPGHOME for all its operations.

This package also provides a collection of PGP/GnuPG related scripts:
 * pgp-clean: removes all non-self signatures from key
 * pgp-fixkey: removes broken packets from keys
 * gpg-mailkeys: simply mail out a signed key to its owner
 * gpg-key2ps: generate PostScript file with fingerprint paper strips
 * gpglist: show who signed which of your UIDs
 * gpgsigs: annotates list of GnuPG keys with already done signatures
 * keylookup: ncurses wrapper around gpg --search
