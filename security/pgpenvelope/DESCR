The purpose of pgpenvelope is to allow easy use of GnuPG
to encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify messages using Pine's send-
ing/displaying filters.

Simply make the appropriate filter entries in one's Pine
configuration, and run Pine as normal.  When sending mail,
choose the pgpenvelope_encrypt filter.  Additionally, one
can use it as a procmail filter.
