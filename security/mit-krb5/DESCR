Kerberos V5 is an authentication system developed at MIT. It is a network
authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for
client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. (Kerberos
5 is discussed in RFC 1510.)

This package provides Kerberos and GSSAPI (Generic Security Services
Application Programming Interface) development headers and libraries.
It also includes Kerberos ticket and principal tools, and Kerberized
r-services, telnet and ftp services.
