Pakemon has been developped to share IDS components based on the
open source development model.  The current version of pakemon
monitors all traffic on a network, reconstruct ip packets and tcp
segment, search given data patterns(regular expression) in the
traffic and issue alerts if necessary, log to a file or send a
message to syslog.

This software is for experimental.  Please use this at your own
risk.  There are still many things to improve.  If you have any
suggestion, question, idea or comments please feel free to contact
the author, keiji@sfc.keio.ac.jp or to the mailing list
pakemon-devel@inas.mag.keio.ac.jp.
