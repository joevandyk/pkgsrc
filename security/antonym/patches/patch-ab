 INSTALLATION
 
-  Copy 'antonym' to a directory in your $PATH.
-
   Get a .remailers file if you don't already have one.  An easy way to do
   this is by asking Antonym to fetch one for you:
 
     antonym update
 
-  Create your configuration file, 'replyblocks.dat'.  See the included
-  'replyblocks.dat.example' for instructions.  This is probably the hardest
-  part of using antonym, but it's not really *that* difficult, and you only
-  have to do it when you're creating a new nym.  Hint: the 'phrase' and
-  'password' commands can be helpful when writing your new reply block.
+  Create your configuration file, '$HOME/.antonym'.  See the included
+  'dot.antonym' (in PREFIX/share/examples/antonym) for instructions.
+  This is probably the hardest part of using antonym, but it's not really
+  *that* difficult, and you only have to change it again when you're
+  creating a new nym.  Hint: the 'phrase' and 'password' commands can be
+  helpful when writing your new reply block.
