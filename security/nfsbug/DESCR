This package consists of two parts, of which the first one ("nfsbug")
verifies a given NFS-server for known bugs like world wide exportable
file systems, determine whether the export list really works,
determine whether we can mount file systems through the portmapper,
try to guess file handles, excercise the mknod bug, and the uid
masking bug.

The second program ("nfsshell") is included for demonstration purpose
to display the named deficiencies by offering a shell-like interface
to access NFS file systems.
