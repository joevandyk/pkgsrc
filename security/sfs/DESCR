SFS is a secure, global network file system with completely
decentralized control. SFS lets you access your files from anywhere
and share them with anyone, anywhere. Anyone can set up an SFS
server, and any user can access any server from any client. SFS
lets you share files across administrative realms without involving
administrators or certification authorities.
