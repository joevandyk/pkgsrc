GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG
easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for
encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.

This is the 0.3 branch of the package; for newer versions
look into the ``gpgme'' package.
