This is a perl program to collect entropy from a running Unix-like system,
mostly through various stats calls (vmstat and friends). The output is
hashed into a pool, stirred with an SHA1 hash, and used to provide
(theoretically) high-quality random data to callers over a UNIX- or TCP-
socket interface. This aims to provide functionality similar to the Linux
/dev/random device, but implemented in a fairly-portable user-space daemon
so that it can run on many unix-like systems. See the README for common
usage details.
