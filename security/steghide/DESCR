Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in
various kinds of image and audio files.  The original color and sample
frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant
against first-order statistical tests.

Features:
  * compression of embedded data
  * encryption of embedded data
  * embedding a checksum to verify the integrity of the extracted data
  * support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU files
