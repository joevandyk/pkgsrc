# A spec file is sourced by the pkg_regress script. The following variables
# control the basic aspects of the individual test.
#
# Variables starting TEST_ are reserved, and should not be used in this file.
#

# MAKEARGS_TEST is the make target(s) and any extra arguments to invoke make
# in the regression testing directory. If empty, make will be invoked with
# no arguments.

MAKEARGS_TEST=install

# MAKEARGS_CLEAN is the make target(s) and any extra arguments to invoke make
# in the regression testing directory in order to clean up. This is the final
# step which is taken, and occurs after the determination of pass/fail for
# the test. A typical value for this variable may be "deinstall clean".
# This variable is optional.

#MAKEARGS_CLEAN=


check_result()
{
# exit_status compares its argument against the exit status from make. If not
# the same, the test is failed.

exit_status 1

# output_require passes a list of patterns to egrep to check for in the output
# from the make invocation. If any pattern is not matched, the test is failed.

# output_prohibit passes a list of patterns to egrep to check for in the output
# from the make invocation. If any pattern is matched, the test is failed.

# Environment variables may be set here to be passed to subprocesses such as
# make.

#export VARIABLE=value

# Other scripting that may be required prior to execution of the test may
# be placed here. Please note that if possible, logic should be confined
# to the Makefile and not placed here.
