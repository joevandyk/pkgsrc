Leafpad is a GTK+ based simple text editor and is ideal as a file viewer.
The user interface is similar to "notepad", aims to be lighter than GEdit
and KWrite, and to be as useful as them.

Its features are:

* Minimum requirements: for portability.
* Minimal menu items: to make full use of features and to learn easily.
* No toolbar: to maximize the text area.
* Single document interface (SDI): to set out windows to view at a time.
* Character coding auto detection: to open file quickly without multi-codeset
  problems.
