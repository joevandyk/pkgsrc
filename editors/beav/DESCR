BEAV (Binary Editor And Viewer), is a full featured binary file
editor.	  Just about any operation that you could want to do to a binary
file is possible with BEAV.   You can insert or delete in the middle of
a file thereby changing its size.   You can edit multiple files in
multiple windows and cut and paste between them.   You can display and
edit data in hex, octal, decimal, binary, ascii, or ebcdic formats.   You
can display data in byte, word, or long word formats in either Intel or
Motorola byte ordering.   You can send the formatted display mode to a
file or printer.
