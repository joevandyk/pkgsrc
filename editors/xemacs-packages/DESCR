Starting with release 21, xemacs does not come with lisp packages
any more. Instead, they are distributed separately from the main
sources.

This port attempts to provide a subset of the available packages that
should be useful for most users.

To install additional packages, use the "Manage Packages" menu
in the "Options" menu of your xemacs' menubar.
