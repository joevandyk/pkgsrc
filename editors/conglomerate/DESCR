Conglomerate is a project to create a complete structured information
authoring, management, archival, revision control and transformation system.
Conglomerate uses XML semantics and powerful graphical editing, coupled with
a centralised storage model and a flexible transformation language to create
an environment which is easy to use, produces high-quality structured output
and lets the user target several output media with a single source document.
