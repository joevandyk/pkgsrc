Pico is a simple text editor with limited searching, block cut and
paste, and spell checking features.

The pico package provides libpico, the library used by the Pine
email client for its display and text editing capabilities.

This also includes pilot(1), which is a simple, console-based,
display-oriented file system navigator.  Pilot provides basic file
manipulation commands.
