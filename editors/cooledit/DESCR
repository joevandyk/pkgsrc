Cooledit is a full-featured text editor, for Unix computers that run
the X Window System.  Cooledit was born from a need for a user
friendly text editor that would rival editors of other operating
systems in ease of use and convenience.  Lately Cooledit is also a
powerful programmer's editor.  It is also small and fast, making it
ideal for interface with applications that allow for, or require, an
external editor.  See 'Features' in the man page for a more elaborate
description of what Cooledit can do.
