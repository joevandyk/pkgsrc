Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.

If you are building the package from source you may want to enable some
features such as a perl or python interpreter which are not enabled by
default.

This version also contains a X11 Athena GUI. Use the variable XAW_TYPE
to select between the `flat' and 3d widget set. If you don't have X11,
look at the `vim' package instead.
