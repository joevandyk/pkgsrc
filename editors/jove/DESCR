JOVE ("Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs") is an emacs-like editor less all
the overhead of the LISP engine.  But for projects that don't require all
the chrome of EMACS, JOVE will get the job done.  It supports split
screens, shell windows, process control, customizable comment formatting
and other features.  No syntax highlighting, colorisation or any of the
other chrome.

There is an 'X' version of jove included but it only works with SunTools
or OpenWindows.  Hopefully this will be expanded.  It is not compiled in
by default.

If you want something more like EMACS, use EMACS.
