Mg (mg) is a Public Domain EMACS style editor.  It is "broadly"
compatible with GNU Emacs.  Mg was formerly named MicroGnuEmacs,
but is not associated with the GNU project.

This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs.

The NetBSD version has a few minor cosmetic changes, better locating
of the startup file (mg.rc), journaling and original mirroring of
files.

A similarly small and fast MSDOS version will be available sometime at
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/editor/mg2a_exe.zip, without
my enhancements.  Hopefully , I'll have time to make a port of this
enhanced version to MSDOS under djgpp (LFN support), and post it as:
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2apps/mg2a110b.zip.

we make any claim as to the suitability of mg2a for any application.
