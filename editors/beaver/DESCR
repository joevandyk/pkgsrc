Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR, for Linux and other Unices
(and even Windows); in other words, it's a text editor that is
intended to be light-weight, but full of useful features for
programming, from editing of web sites to C coding.

It is based upon the GTK+ toolkit, supports many languages
through config files and offers functions such as automatic
indentation and completion or syntax highlighting.  In fact,
it is 100% compatible with Ultraedit's wordfile.txt files,
and has its own mini macro language.
