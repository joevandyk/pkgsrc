This is an X11 version of Rob Pike's editor, sam.  Documentation describing
its use and construction are provided in subdirectory doc.  The file doc/sam.1
contains the manual page; doc/sam.tut.ms is a tutorial that can be
formatted with troff -ms.  It substitutes Bold and Italics for the
fonts named CW and CS; if your system has these fonts, remove the
CW and CS macros at the beginning of the file. The files doc/sam.ps
and doc/se.ps are postscript versions of published papers describing
sam and structural regular expressions.  These papers reflect sam's
capabilities at the time of publication several years ago; while the
general description remains accurate, some functions may have changed
or been removed.  Other files in the doc directory contain manual pages
for the library packages used by sam.

Sam is composed of two programs: sam itself, which does the command processing
and file manipulation; and samterm, which controls the display and
interacts with the user.  You can run sam on one machine and samterm on another
connected via remote execution.
