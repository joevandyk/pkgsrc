Gobby is a free collaborative editor. This means that it provides you
with the possibility to edit files simultaneously with other users over
a network. It supports multiple documents in one session and a
multi-user chat. The platforms on which you could use Gobby are so far
Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and other Unix-like ones. Developed
with the Gtk+ toolkit it integrates nicely into the GNOME desktop
environment if you want it to.
