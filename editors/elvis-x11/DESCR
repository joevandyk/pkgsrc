This is the X11 GUI version of Elvis. It includes the console version, as well.

Elvis - written by Steve Kirkendall is a very powerful vi/ex clone providing
a remarkable number of bells and whistles like:

	* Syntax Highlighting.
	* Multiple files in multiple windows.
	* Browse modes for LaTeX (rather experimental), HTML and MAN pages.
	* Networking support (http and ftp).
	* GUI frontends for some of its platforms.
