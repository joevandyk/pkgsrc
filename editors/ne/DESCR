NE is a text editor that is designed to run on a wide variety
of machines, from large servers to personal workstations. Its
main use is expected to be as an interactive screen editor.
However, it can also function as a line-by-line editor, and it
is programmable, so it can be run non-interactively as a text
manipulation tool.

NE is a re-implementation of a previous editor that was called
E. It is to a large extent upwards compatible, though there
are some features of E that are not provided in NE. On the
other hand, there are some additional features of NE that are
not part of E.
