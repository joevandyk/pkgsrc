   read(2)   1024 bytes in process_read_output
   read(2)     11 bytes in process_read_output

   That is, read(2) returns more bytes than have ever been written
   successfully.  The 1033 bytes read are the 1022 bytes written
   successfully after processing (for example with CRs added if the
   terminal is set up that way which it is here).  The same bytes will
   be seen again in a later read(2), without the CRs.  */
