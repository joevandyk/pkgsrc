The above macros may contain references to shell variables.

The cause of this problem is usually that in a configure.ac or
configure.in file, there is some code like

    FOO_DIR="\${bindir}"
    AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(FOO_DIR, "\$FOO_DIR", [Directory where foo files go])

You can fix this by telling the original package author not to use
AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED for directories. Instead, {he,she} should do
something like this:

    # in configure.ac:
    foodir="\${bindir}"
    AC_SUBST(FOO_DIR)

    # in the Makefile.am files (can be more than one):
    AM_CPPFLAGS= -DFOO_DIR=\\"@FOO_DIR@\\"

If this check is wrong and the package really wants to have "\${" in the
macros, append the above filenames to the CHECK_HEADERS_SKIP variable in
the package Makefile.
