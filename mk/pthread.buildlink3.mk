# The pthreads strategy for pkgsrc is to "bless" a particular pthread
# package as the Official Pthread Replacement (OPR).  The following
# variables may be set before including this file:
#
# PTHREAD_OPTS?= # empty
#	A list of options to configure the search for a suitable pthreads
#	implementation.
#
#	"native" means that only a native pthreads implementation is
#		acceptable.
#
#	"optional" will override the effects of any instance of
#		"require".  This should _only_ be used by those packages
#		that can be built with or without pthreads independently
#		of whether any of its dependencies need pthreads.
#		Currently, this is only www/mozilla, which uses its own
#		threading library if native pthreads are unavailable,
#		despite that it uses GTK+, which _does_ need pthreads.
#
#	"require" means that the package is skipped silently when no
#		implementation can be found.
#
#	By default, the native pthreads implementation is used if it's
#	available. Otherwise the OPR is used.
#
# PTHREAD_AUTO_VARS?= no
#	This variable specifies whether the values of the variables
#	PTHREAD_{CFLAGS,CPPFLAGS,LDFLAGS,LIBS} should be automatically
#	added to their respective variables.
#
# After inclusion of this file, the following variables may be examined:
#
# PTHREAD_TYPE
#	The type of pthreads implementation that has been found.
#
#	"native" means that the native pthreads implementation is used.
#
#	"none" means that no suitable pthreads implementation could be
#		found.
#
#	Any other value is the name of the package that is used as the
#	pthread implementation.
#
#	Note that it's only safe to check and use the value of PTHREAD_TYPE
#	after all other buildlink3.mk files have been included.
#
# The case where a package must use either the native pthread library or
# some pthread package aside from the OPR (e.g. "ptl2") can be solved as
# follows:
#
#	PTHREAD_OPTS+=	native
#	#
#	# more package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink3.mk"
#
#	.if defined(PTHREAD_TYPE) && ${PTHREAD_TYPE} == "none"
#	.  include "../../devel/ptl2/buildlink3.mk"
#	.endif
#
