#
# RPM package format
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# RPM2PKG_PLIST
#	This is the path to the PLIST created by rpm2pkg(8) which will
#	list the files and directories extracted from the RPMs.  If
#	this is empty, then no PLIST is created.
#
#	Default value: ${WRKDIR}/.PLIST.rpm2pkg
#
# RPM2PKG_PREFIX
#	This is the directory under which the contents of the RPMs will
#	be extracted.  This directory is stripped from the paths which
#	are stored in ${RPM2PKG_PLIST}.
#
#	Default value: ${WRKDIR}
#
# RPM2PKG_SUBPREFIX
#	This is the subdirectory under ${RPM2PKG_PREFIX} within which
#	the RPMs are directly extracted.  If this is empty, then the
#	RPMs are extracted directly into ${RPM2PKG_PREFIX}.
#
#	Default value: empty
#
# RPM2PKG_STRIP
#	This is the number of path components to strip from the head
#	of paths of files and directories stored in the RPMs during
#	extraction.  RPMs usually store all paths with a leading path
#	component of ``./''.
#
#	Default value: 1
#
# RPM2PKG_STAGE
#	Stage at which to run the ``extract-rpm'' target.
#
#	Default value: do-extract
#
# RPMFILES
#	The list of paths to RPMs to extract using rpm2pkg(8).
#
#	Default value: all *.rpm files in DISTFILES located in ${_DISTDIR}
#
# RPMIGNOREPATH
#	The list of files or paths to skip during extraction of the RPMs.
#
#	Default value: undefined
#
# Public targets:
#
# extract-rpm
#	Runs rpm2pkg(8) with the appropriate arguments based on the
#	RPM* variables set in the package Makefile to extract the
#	files listed in RPMFILES.
