# This Makefile fragment defines additional variables that are used
# by packages that need digest.
#
# Optional variables that may be defined by the package are:
#
#	DIGEST_REQD is the minimum version of digest required.
#
# This file needs to be included before replace.mk as it uses the
# replace.mk magic to set the TOOLS_DIGEST and DIGEST variables.
