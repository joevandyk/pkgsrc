TEXINFO_REQD?=		3.12

# If the package doesn't explicitly request makeinfo as a tool, then
# create a "broken" makeinfo tool to fool GNU configure scripts into
# believing that makeinfo is broken on ths sytem.  It will return non-zero
# if invoked as "makeinfo --version".  Otherwise, it will just touch the
# appropriate output file to satisfy any make dependencies.
#
# If the package does explicitly request makeinfo as a tool, then
# determine if the platform-provided makeinfo's version is at least
# ${TEXINFO_REQD}.  If it isn't, then tell the tools framework to use
# the pkgsrc makeinfo.
