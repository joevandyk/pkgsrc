# This Makefile fragment defines additional variables that are used
# by packages that need imake and xmkmf.
#
# Variables defined by this file are:
#
#	XMKMF, TOOLS_XMKMF
#		command to create all Makefiles from Imakefiles,
#		usually "xmkmf -a".
#
# Optional variables that may be defined by the package are:
#
#	IMAKEOPTS	Options to pass to imake
#	XMKMF_FLAGS	Options to pass to xmkmf
#
# A platform/${OPSYS}.mk file may note that additional tools are
# required when using imake by setting IMAKE_TOOLS to the appropriate
# value, e.g. IMAKE_TOOLS+=gmake to use GNU make to build packages
# that use imake.
#
# This file needs to be included before replace.mk as it modifies the
# USE_TOOLS variables that are used by replace.mk.
#

# These variables do not belong only to this file, but this seemed the
# best place for this paragraph.
