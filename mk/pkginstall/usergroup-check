# NAME
#	usergroup-check -- verify that users/groups match numeric IDs
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	usergroup-check -g [group_entry ...]
#	usergroup-check -u [user_entry ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#       usergroup-check checks for the existence of users and groups
#	and verifies that they match the requested numeric IDs if
#	given.  The group_entry format matches that of /etc/group and
#	the user_entry format matches that of /etc/passwd, though the
#	field contents may be empty.
#
#	usergroup-check exits 0 if the users and groups exist and match
#	the numeric IDs, and >0 otherwise.
#
# OPTIONS
#	The following command line arguments are supported.
#
#	-g      Indicates that the subsequent arguments are group entries.
#
#	-u      Indicates that the subsequent arguments are user entries.
