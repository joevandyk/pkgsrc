### This awk script handles libtool archive entries in PLISTs.  This script
### requires the following scripts to be included:
###
###	plist-functions.awk (print_entry)
###
### Certain environment variables must be set prior to running this script:
###
### IGNORE_LIBTOOLIZE is a whitespace-separated list of ${PREFIX}-relative
###	paths to *.la files that should not be expanded.
###
### LIBTOOL_EXPAND is the path to the script that prints out the
###	actual library files associated with a libtool archive file.
###
### LIBTOOLIZE_PLIST is a yes/no variable indicating whether to expand
###	*.la files in the PLIST into the corresponding real libraries.
###
### PREFIX is the installation prefix of the the package.
###
### TEST is the command used for shell tests, e.g. shell test built-in or
###	the path to a "test" binary.
###
