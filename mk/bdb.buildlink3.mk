# $NetBSD: bdb.buildlink3.mk,v 1.20 2007/10/17 10:43:36 rillig Exp $
#
# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that
# require a Berkeley DB implementation.  It abstracts finding the
# appropriate library, choosing among built-in or pkgsrc-provided
# db-1.85, and choosing among db[234].
#
# There is a default version for db[234], which is db4 unless already
# set (e.g. in /etc/mk.conf).  While it is nice to have fewer versions
# installed, the real problem is installed dynamic libraries that link
# against bdb.  These cannot be used with a program linked against a
# different version, and hence this Makefile is written to cause only
# one version to be used whenever possible.
#
# This Makefile can handle several cases:
#   package requires db-1.85
#   package can use any of db[234]
#   package can use db-1.85 or any of db[234]
#   package can use db-1.85 which is builtin and some subset of db[234]
#
# This Makefile does not handle:
#   packages that need a specific version, e.g. db2
#     [in such cases, include ../../database/db2/buildlink3.mk directly]
#   packages that can use e.g. db3 or db4, but not db2
#     [there is no good way to handle this at present]
#
# bdb.buildlink3.mk will:
#
#       * set BDBBASE to the base directory of the Berkeley DB files;
#	* set BDB_LIBS to the library option needed to link against
#	  the Berkeley DB library;
#       * set BDB_TYPE to the Berkeley DB implementation used.
#
# User-settable variables:
#
# BDB_DEFAULT
#	This value represents the package we use when either a db-1.85
#	interface isn't required, or a db-1.85 interface is required,
#	but it's not built-in.
#
#	FIXME: Improve the wording of the text above so that one can
#	understand it.
#
# BDB185_DEFAULT
#	The package we use when a db-1.85 interface is required.
#	It defaults to "db1" if it's built-in, or to ${BDB_DEFAULT}
#	otherwise.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# BDB_ACCEPTED
#	The list of Berkeley DB implementations
#       that may be used by the package.  Note that if the list does not
#	include db1 and does not include BDB_DEFAULT, the package will not
#	build - this is the second unhandled case above.
#
# Note for when databases/db1 is imported:
#   (1) Remove the section that conditionally sets the default
#	value for BDB185_DEFAULT and always set it to be "db1".
#   (2) Remove the special case for ${BDB_TYPE} == "db1" at the end.
#   (3) Move mk/db1.builtin.mk to databases/db1/builtin.mk.
