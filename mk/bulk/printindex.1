.Sh NAME
.Nm printindex
.Nd generate a PKGPATH to PKGNAME mapping database file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar brokenfile Op Ar bulkfilesdir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Generates a mapping from pkgsrc directories to the current package
version and prints it on stdout.
It also checks whether the package can be built on this system at all
and marks those that cannot be built as broken.
.Pp
Each line of the output has two fields:
the package directory (in the form
.Ql category/package )
and the package version (in the form
.Ql package-1.456nb3 ) .
.Pp
If
.Ar brokenfile
is given, package-specific errors are logged to
.Ar bulkfilesdir Ns / Ns
.Va ${pkgdir} Ns / Ns
.Ar brokenfile .
Otherwise no additional logging takes place.
.Pp
The default for
.Ar bulkfilesdir
is the pkgsrc directory itself.
If
.Ar bulkfilesdir
differs from the pkgsrc directory, all directories that are needed for
the log files are created automatically.
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm
must be called from a pkgsrc root directory.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Non-zero if writing to a log file fails, zero otherwise.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Ev BMAKE Pq mandatory

.Xr make 1

.It Ev PKGLIST Pq optional
The list of packages from which to build an index.
