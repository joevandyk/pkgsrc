##
## For this to work, put
##   DEPENDS_TARGET=	bulk-install
##   BATCH=		yes
## into your /etc/mk.conf, then cd /usr/pkgsrc; make bulk-package
##
## bulk-install will only compile pkgs if necessary, and install binary
##	pkgs if possible/available.
## bulk-package will build binary packages, and remove them (together with
##	any depending packages) immediately after that, leaving only the
##	binary package back. Broken packages are marked (``.broken'').

# This variable is set to 'yes' by the pkgsrc/mk/bulk/build script.  It enables
# the use of several cache files (DEPENDSTREEFILE, DEPENDSFILE, SUPPORTSFILE,
# and INDEXFILE) for speeding up the processing of dependencies.  If we're not
# actively in the middle of a bulk build, however, we don't know that these files
# exist or are up to date and they take quite a while to rebuild.  So unless
# they're known to exist and be up to date, don't use them.
USE_BULK_CACHE?=	no

# If set to 'yes', avoids inflating the 'breaks' column of the final report
# by not counting dependent packages that are broken all by themselves.
# If set to 'no', may speed up building on some platforms where fork() is slow.
# (Only takes effect if USE_BULK_CACHE=yes.)
USE_BULK_BROKEN_CHECK?=	yes

# This variable may be set to 'no' to avoid automatic rebuilding of dependent
# packages based solely on timestamps of the package's pkgsrc files and/or
# its dependency binary packages.  This will cause rebuilding only when the
# full version number of the package changes (e.g., via PKGREVISION bump).
USE_BULK_TIMESTAMPS?=	yes
