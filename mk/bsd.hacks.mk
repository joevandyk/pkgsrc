# This Makefile fragment automatically includes the necessary hacks to
# make the package build correctly by including the package's hacks.mk
# file if it exists.
#
# An example package hacks.mk:

# -------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------
# .if !defined(FOO_HACKS_MK)
# FOO_HACKS_MK=	defined
#
# ### [Sun Nov 14 02:08:31 EST 2004 : jlam]
# ### arm GCC 2.95.x optimisation bug tickled when compiling
# ### lib/funkyfile.c.  Require a more recent version of GCC as a
# ### workaround and patch lib/funkyfile.c (patch-ae).

# .if !empty(MACHINE_ARCH:Marm*)
# PKG_HACKS+=	optimisation
# GCC_REQD+=	3.0
# .endif
