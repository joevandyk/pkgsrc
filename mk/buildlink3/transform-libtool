# Workaround software authors that don't follow the libtool
# documentation and link against uninstalled libtool archives with:
#
#	-L../package/source/dir -lfoo
#
# instead of the correct (according to the libtool documentation)
#
#	../package/source/dir/libfoo.la
#
# We convert the former into the latter by remembering all "local"
# directories that are mentioned in -L* arguments to to libtool
# wrapper, and checking to see if <dir>/libfoo.la exists when we see
# "-lfoo" on the libtool command line.  Avoid matching the buildlink
# directory here for the WRKSRC == WRKDIR case.
