# Include this file to set the value of USE_BUILTIN.<pkg> for each
# package listed in BUILDLINK_PACKAGES.  Note that this file may
# indirectly add additional values to BUILDLINK_PACKAGES.
#
# For each package which may duplicate built-in software on the system,
# a builtin.mk file should be created.  The only requirements of a
# builtin.mk file are:
#
#   (1) It should set USE_BUILTIN.<pkg> to either "yes" or "no" after it
#       is included.
#   (2) It should *not* override any USE_BUILTIN.<pkg> which is already
#       set before the builtin.mk file is included.
#   (3) It should be written to allow multiple inclusion.
#
# An example package builtin.mk file is:
#
# -------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------
# BUILTIN_PKG:=	wibble
# .include "../../mk/buildlink3/bsd.builtin.mk"
#
# ###
# ### Determine if there is a built-in implementation of the package and
# ### set IS_BUILTIN.<pkg> appropriately ("yes" or "no").
# ###
# .if !defined(IS_BUILTIN.wibble)
# IS_BUILTIN.wibble=	no
# .endif
# MAKEVARS+=	IS_BUILTIN.wibble
#
# ###
# ### If there is a built-in implementation, then set BUILTIN_PKG.<pkg> to
# ### a package name to represent the built-in package.
# ###
# .if !defined(BUILTIN_PKG.wibble) && \
#     !empty(IS_BUILTIN.wibble:M[yY][eE][sS])
# BUILTIN_PKG.wibble=	wibble-1.0
# .endif
# MAKEVARS+=	BUILTIN_PKG.wibble
#
# ###
# ### Determine whether we should use the built-in implementation if it
# ### exists, and set USE_BUILTIN.<pkg> appropriate ("yes" or "no").
# ###

# .  if ${PREFER.wibble} == "pkgsrc"
# USE_BUILTIN.wibble=	no

# CHECK_BUILTIN.<pkg>.  Package builtin.mk files aren't protected against
