# This Makefile fragment is included separately by bsd.pkg.mk and
# defines some variables which must be defined earlier than where
# bsd.patch.mk is included.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
#    PATCHFILES is a list of distribution patches relative to
#	${_DISTDIR} that are applied first to the package.
#
#    PATCHDIR is the location of the pkgsrc patches for the package.
#	This defaults to the "patches" subdirectory of the package
#	directory.
#
# User-settable variables:
#
#    LOCALPATCHES is the location of local patches that are maintained
#	in a directory tree reflecting the same hierarchy as the pkgsrc
#	tree, e.g., local patches for www/apache would be found in
#	${LOCALPATCHES}/www/apache.  These patches are applied after
#	the patches in ${PATCHDIR}.
#

# The default PATCHDIR is currently set in bsd.prefs.mk
#PATCHDIR?=	${.CURDIR}/patches

PATCHFILES?=	# none

pkgsrc_patches=	${:!echo ${PATCHDIR}/patch-* ${PATCHDIR}/emul-*-patch-*!:N*\*}
