Ragel compiles finite state machines from regular languages into
executable C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java, or Ruby code.  Ragel state
machines can not only recognize byte sequences as regular expression
machines do, but can also execute code at arbitrary points in the
recognition of a regular language.  Code embedding is done using
inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.
