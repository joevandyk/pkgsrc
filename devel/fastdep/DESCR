fastdep is a fast dependency generator for C/C++ files.  It generates a
file ready to be parsed by the make(1) utility containing dependency
specifications for all source files given to it.

The program is written in C++ with a hand optimized parser for just the
preprocessor tokens; therefore it is faster than GCC because it does
just one thing.
