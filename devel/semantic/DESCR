The Semantic Bovinator is a lexer, parser-generator, and parser. It is
written in Emacs Lisp and is customized to the way Emacs thinks about
language files, and is optimized to use Emacs' parsing capabilities.

The Semantic Bovinator's goal is to provide an intermediate API for
authors of language agnostic tools who want to deal with languages in
a generic way. It also provides a simple way for Mode Authors who are
experts in their language to provide a parser for those tool
authors, without knowing anything about those tools.

The Semantic Bovinator is made up of these important pieces:
    1. lexer
    2. parser
    3. parser-generator
    4. language definitions
    5. navigator
    6. speedbar browser
    7. Documentation generator
