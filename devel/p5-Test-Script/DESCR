The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for
scripts in the bin directory of your Perl distribution.
Further, it aims to provide them with perfect platform-compatibility
and in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible.
That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should
also work on that platform.
In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that
you can safely make a dependency of your module, without risking your
module not working on some platform because of the dependency.
Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and
maintaining platform safety, this module will err on the side of
platform safety.
