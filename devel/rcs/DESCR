RCS manages software libraries.  It  greatly  increases
programmer  productivity  by  providing  the following functions.

1.   RCS stores and retrieves multiple revisions of  program and  other  text.
2.   RCS maintains a complete history of changes.
3.   RCS manages multiple lines of development.
4.   RCS can merge multiple  lines  of  development.
5.   RCS flags coding conflicts.
6.   RCS resolves access conflicts.
7.   RCS provides high-level retrieval functions.
8.   RCS provides release and configuration control.
9.   RCS performs automatic identification of  modules  with
     name,  revision  number,  creation  time,  author, etc.
10.  Provides high-level management visibility.
11.  RCS is fully compatible with existing software development tools.
12.  RCS' basic user  interface  is  extremely  simple.
13.  RCS simplifies software distribution if customers main-
     tain  sources  with  RCS  also.
14.  RCS needs little extra space for  the  revisions  (only the differences).
15.  RCS is implemented with reverse deltas. This means that
     the latest revision, which is the one that is accessed most
     often, is stored intact.  This results in fast access time for
     the revision needed most often.
