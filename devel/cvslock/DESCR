The cvslock (1) program is used to safely manipulate and inspect CVS
repositories; to this end, it properly uses CVS' lock file mechanism.

The primary application for which this program was created was
keeping several instances of the same CVS repository in synch; using
CVSup which apparently does a superior task at this was not an
option in my precise application.
