Argp is an interface for parsing unix-style argument vectors.

Argp provides features unavailable in the more commonly used getopt
interface.  These features include automatically producing output in
response to the `--help' and `--version' options, as described in the
GNU coding standards.  Using argp makes it less likely that
programmers will neglect to implement these additional options or keep
them up to date.

Argp also provides the ability to merge several independently defined
option parsers into one, mediating conflicts between them and making
the result appear seamless.  A library can export an argp option
parser that user programs might employ in conjunction with their own
option parsers, resulting in less work for the user programs.  Some
programs may use only argument parsers exported by libraries, thereby
achieving consistent and efficient option-parsing for abstractions
implemented by the libraries.

The header file <argp.h> should be included to use argp.
