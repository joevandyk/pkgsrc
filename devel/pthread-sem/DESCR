  This is a simple POSIX-style semaphore implementation that can be used
with pthread libraries that don't come with POSIX semaphores.  At the
moment, this is a quick hack that does not implement all functions.  The
functions that are implemented are probably not 100% POSIX compliant.  Use
at your own risk!
