Event::ExecFlow offers a high level API to declare jobs, which mainly
execute external commands, parse their output to get progress or other
status information, triggers actions when the command has been finished
etc. Such jobs can be chained together in a recursive fashion to fulfill
rather complex tasks which consist of many jobs.
