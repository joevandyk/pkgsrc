The debug memory allocation, or dmalloc, library has been
designed as a drop-in replacement for the system's malloc(),
realloc(), calloc(), free(), and other memory management
routines while providing powerful debugging facilities
configurable at run-time.  These facilities include such
things as memory leak tracking, fence-post write detection,
file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.
