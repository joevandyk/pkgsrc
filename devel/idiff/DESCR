idiff is an interactive front-end to the diff(1) program.

Taken from "The Unix Programming Environment" book, by Kernighan and
Pike.

When a difference is found, idiff gives you the opportunity to use the
old portion ('<'), the new portion ('>') or to edit the difference via
an editor. Shell escapes can also be made.

Output is placed in the idiff.out file.
