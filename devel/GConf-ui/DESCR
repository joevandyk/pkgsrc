GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. It was written for the GNOME
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME
is not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.

This package installs graphical utilities included in GConf's
distribution file.
