dmake is different from other versions of Make in that it supports significant
enhancements (See the WWW page).  A short summary of the more important
features follows:

        . support for portable makefiles
        . portable accross many platforms
        . significantly enhanced macro facilities
        . sophisticated inference algorithm supporting transitive closure
          over the inference graph
        . support for traversing the file sytem both during making of targets
          and during inference
        . %-meta rules for specifying rules to be used for inferring
          prerequisites
        . conditional macros
        . local rule macro variables
        . proper support for libraries
        . parallel making of targets on architectures that support it
        . attributed targets
        . text diversions
        . group recipes
        . swapping itself to DISK under MSDOS
        . supports MKS extended argument passing convention
        . directory caching
        . highly configurable
