Tailor is a tool to migrate changesets between ArX, Bazaar,
`Bazaar-NG`, CVS, Codeville, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone,
Subversion, and Tla repositories.

This script makes it easier to keep the upstream changes merged in
a branch of a product, storing needed information such as the
upstream URI and revision in special properties on the branched
directory.
