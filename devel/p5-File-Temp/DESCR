File::Temp - provides functions for generating temporary files

This module can be used to generate temporary files (providing a filename
and filehandle) or directories.
Possible race conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed
(eg making sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).

It could be considered to be in a beta state since it has only been
tested on six operating systems.
