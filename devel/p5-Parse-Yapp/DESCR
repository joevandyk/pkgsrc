Parse::Yapp

Yet Another Perl Parser compiler.  Compiles yacc-like LALR grammars
to generate Perl OO parser modules.  It lets you create Perl OO
fully reentrant LALR(1) parser modules (see the Yapp.pm pod pages
for more details) and has been designed to be functionally as close
as possible to yacc, but using the full power of Perl and opened
for enhancements.
