One of the main concerns of Gobo Eiffel is to provide you with Eiffel
libraries and tools that are portable across various Eiffel compilers
available on the market. That way, you can still use your favorite Eiffel
compiler while taking advantage of the goodies included in this package.

This package consists of five Eiffel libraries:

       Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library
       Gobo Eiffel Structure Library
       Gobo Eiffel Lexical Library
       Gobo Eiffel Parse Library
       Gobo Eiffel Utility Library

and three utilities:

       Gobo Eiffel Lex (gelex)
       Gobo Eiffel Yacc (geyacc)
       Gobo Eiffel Preprocessor (gepp)
