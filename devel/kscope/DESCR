KScope is a source-editing environment for KDE. Primarily, it is a
front-end to the veteran Cscope, a source-code browser originally
developed at Bell XLabs. Cscope works by parsing a set of source files,
creating a cross- reference database, and allowing the user to query
this database. KScope, however, extends the feature-set of Cscope with
a contemporary user Xinterface, editor integration, project management
capabilities, and multiple query result windows.
