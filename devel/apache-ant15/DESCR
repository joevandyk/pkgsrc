Ant is a Java based build tool. In theory it is kind of like
"make" without make's wrinkles and with the full portability
of pure java code.

Ant uses XML to specify build actions to be taken, and new
build actions are implemented in Java.

This is the last version of apache-ant that supports Java 1.1
