libdockapp is a simple (trivial) library for writing Window Maker dock
applications, or dockapps (those that only show up in the dock), easily.

It is very limited and can be only used for dockapps that open a single
appicon for a process in only one single display, but this seems to be
enough for most, if not all, dockapps.
