"SLIB" is a portable library for the programming language "Scheme".  It       |
provides a platform independent framework for using "packages" of             |
Scheme procedures and syntax.  As distributed, SLIB contains useful
packages for all Scheme implementations.  Its catalog can be                  |
transparently extended to accomodate packages specific to a site,             |
implementation, user, or directory.                                           |
