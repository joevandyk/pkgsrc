STLPort features a complete ANSI C++ standard library. Main features are:
+ Includes <complex> and SGI iostreams.
+ Can be configured to use either SGI or native iostreams.
+ Debug mode containers are implemented in terms of wrappers around non-debug
  ones. That provides for more clean and efficient implementation. In Debug
  Mode, different namespace _STLD:: is being used, so no link-time clashes
  between debug and non-debug versions are possible.
