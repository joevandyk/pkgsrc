This small set of tools provides a means for importing a CVS module
into Perforce.

It was originally developed for use at Network Appliance, to convert
our product source code revision history from CVS into Perforce.

cvs2p4 tries make the resultant Perforce depot look as if the work in
CVS had been going on in Perforce.
