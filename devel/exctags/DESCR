Exuberant Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of source language
objects in source files that allows these items to be quickly and
easily located by a text editor or other utility.

Alternatively, it can generate a cross reference file which lists,
in human-readable form, information about the various objects found
in a set of source code files.

Supported languages include: Assembler, ASP, Awk, C, C++, BETA, COBOL, Eiffel,
Fortran, Java, Lisp, Make, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby, Scheme,
Shell scripts (Bourne/Korn/Z), S-Lang, Tcl, Vim  and YACC/Bison.
