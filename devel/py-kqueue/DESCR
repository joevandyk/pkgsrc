py-kqueue is Python glue for kqueue(2)/kevent(2) event interface
on BSD systems.

kqueue() provides a generic method of notifying the user when an
event happens or a condition holds, based on the results of small
pieces of kernel code termed filters.  A kevent is identified by
the (ident, filter) pair; there may only be one unique kevent
per kqueue.

See the manpages for further information on kqueue system interface.
File pykqueue.txt (part of the module distribution) describes
the Python module API, which mirrors the system interface to most extend.
