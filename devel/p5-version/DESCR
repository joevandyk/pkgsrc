Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and
hopefully in the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use
this module with a version of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not
do anything, since the code already exists in the Perl core.  Note
that the CPAN release cannot be installed with the interim 5.9.0,
5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code in the core).
If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the latest
release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.50.
