RDP compiles attributed LL(1) grammars decorated with C-language
semantic actions into recursive descent compilers. RDP is written in
strict ANSI C and produces strict ANSI C. RDP is designed to be easy
to use, and comes with library support for many of the things that are
left to the user in more traditional tools.
