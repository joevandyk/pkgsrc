   The GNUstep makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible
way to write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the
user to write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.
