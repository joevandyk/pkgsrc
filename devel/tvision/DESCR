Turbo Vision for UNIX

Turbo Vision (or TV, for short) is a library that provides an
application framework for C++ programmers.  With TV, you can write
beautiful object-oriented character-mode user interfaces in a very
short time.

TV is available in C++ and Pascal and is a product of Borland
International.  It was developed to run on MS-DOS systems, but today
it is available for many other platforms (ported by independent
programmers).

This port is based on the Borland 2.0 version with fixes.

Borland has released the source code to the public some time ago (take
a look at the COPYRIGHT file in the source package for more
information).
