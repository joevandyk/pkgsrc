As part of the post installation stage, you should now create a system-wide
configuration file for the bt_config module, containing cached results for
several common checks run by many configure scripts.

For an automated setup, issue the following commands (as ${ROOT_USER}):

	mkdir -p ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}
	cp ${PREFIX}/share/buildtool/templates/bt_config.conf.in \
	    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/bt_config.conf.in
	${PREFIX}/bin/buildtool swcgen
