HUnit is a unit testing framework for Haskell inspired in the JUnit tool
for Java.

A test-centered methodology for software development is most effective
when tests are easy to create, change, and execute.  The JUnit tool
pioneered support for test-first development in Java.  HUnit is an
adaptation of JUnit to Haskell, a general-purpose, purely functional
programming language.

With HUnit (as with JUnit) you can easily create tests, name them, group
them into suites, and execute them, with the framework checking the
results automatically.  Test specification in HUnit is even more concise
and flexible than in JUnit, thanks to the nature of the Haskell language.
HUnit currently includes only a text-based test controller, but the
framework is designed for easy extension.
