The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that
is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community. The software
is released under an Apache/BSD-style open source license.

This package contains all the Subversion programs and libraries except
the Apache module mod_dav_svn (for which see the ap2-subversion
package) and the Python bindings and some programs which use them (for
which see the py-subversion package).  Installing this package
alone will satisfy most people's needs, providing all three repository
access layers (local, svn, and dav) and the server for the svn access
layer.
