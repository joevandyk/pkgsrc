  FHist is a minimalist history tool.  It provides no locking or branching.
This can be useful in contexts where the configuration management or change
control be being provided by some other tool.

fhist    Keeps track of versions of a file.  It works correctly when
         given binary files as input.

fcomp    Compares two versions of a file, usually line-for-line
         textual comparison.  It is capable of comparing two binary
         files byte-for-byte.

fmerge   Merges together edits from two descendants of a file.
