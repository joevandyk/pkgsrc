adocman is the automation tool for SourceForge.net DocManager handling.  This
package provides two Perl-based scripts:

adocman:    The adocman program, providing the means to perform DocManager
            operations from the command-line or scripts (by project developers
            or admins listed as DocManager Editors).

xml_export: The xml_export program, providing the means to automate downloads
            of data from the XML data export facility on SourceForge.net (by
            project administrators).

It also includes the Alexandria Perl API, which lets you perform operations
against the SourceForge.net site, currently including basic Client operations
(i.e. login/logout) and DocManager operations.
