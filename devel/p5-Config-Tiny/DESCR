"Config::Tiny" is a perl class to read and write .ini style
configuration files with as little code as possible, reducing load
time and memory overhead. Most of the time it is accepted that Perl
applications use a lot of memory and modules. The "::Tiny" family
of modules is specifically intended to provide an ultralight
alternative to the standard modules.

This module is primarily for reading human written files, and
anything we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments.
If you need something with more power move up to Config::Simple,
Config::General or one of the many other "Config::" modules. To
rephrase, Config::Tiny does not preserve your comments, whitespace,
or the order of your config file.
