  LibStroke is a stroke translation library.  Strokes are motions of
the mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command.  Strokes
are used extensively in CAD programs.

  Mark Willey, the author of this library wrote: "I fell in love with
them when I was using the Mentor Graphics CAD tools and the CAD tools
internally developed by Intel.  I am writing this library so that
others can see how useful strokes can be and so that more programs
take advantage of this extremely natural human-computer interface."

  LibStroke is available under the GNU Public Licence (GPL).
