The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a C++ library of container
classes, algorithms, and iterators; it provides many of the basic
algorithms and data structures of computer science. The STL is a
generic library, meaning that its components are heavily
parameterized: almost every component in the STL is a template. You
should make sure that you understand how templates work in C++ before
you use the STL.
