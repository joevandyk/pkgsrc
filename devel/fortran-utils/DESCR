Fsplit takes as input either a file or standard input containing
Fortran 77 source code.  It attempts to split the input into separate
routine files of the form name.f, where name is the name of the
program unit (e.g. function, subroutine, block data or program).

Fpr is a filter that transforms files formatted according to Fortran's
carriage control conventions into files formatted according to UNIX
line printer conventions. Fpr copies its input onto its output,
replacing the carriage control characters with characters that will
produce the intended effects when printed using lpr(1).
