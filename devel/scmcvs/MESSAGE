Set up the master source repository.  See the "Setting up the repository"
section of cvs.info for details; the one-line summary is (if you are
putting the repository in /src/master):

	$ cvs -d /src/master init

Have all users of the CVS system set the CVSROOT environment
variable appropriately to reflect the placement of your source
repository.  If the above example is used, the following commands
can be placed in user's ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile file; or in the
system-wide /etc/profile:

	CVSROOT=/src/master; export CVSROOT

for sh/bash/ksh users, or place the following commands in the user's
~/.login, or system-wide in the /etc/csh.login file:

	setenv CVSROOT /src/master

for csh/tcsh users.  If these environment variables are not already set
in your current shell, set them now (or source the login script you
just edited).
