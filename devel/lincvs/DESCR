LinCVS is a graphical Interface for the cvs client commandline tool on the
Unix, Windows and Mac OS X platform. It allows to load modules from a
server (checkout), create modules on the server (import), as well as
checking the state of directories and individual files or updating them.
Basic operations like add, remove and commit are supported as matter of
course, just like showing the actual differences between the server version
and the local sandbox, graphical display of the version tree, and manifoldy
graphical support of project maintenance. All actions are logged on the cvs
server (configurable via history), and are therewith comprehensible.
