Monotone is a free distributed version control system.  It provides a
simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected
operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol.  It
understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight branches, integrated
code review and 3rd party testing.  It uses cryptographic version naming
and client-side RSA certificates.  It has good internationalization
support, has no external dependencies, runs on NetBSD, Linux, Solaris,
OSX and Windows (among others), and is licensed under the GNU GPL.

This package provides all the necessary stuff to easily configure a
dedicated Monotone server.  Of special interest are the included rc.d
script and the monotone-server-init script, which will greatly simplify
the whole process.
