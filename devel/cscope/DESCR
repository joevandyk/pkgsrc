cscope is an interactive, screen-oriented tool that allows the user to
browse through C source files for specified elements of code.

By default, cscope examines the C (.c and .h), lex (.l), and yacc (.y)
source files in the current directory. cscope may also be invoked for
source files named on the command line. In either case, cscope
searches the standard directories for #include files that it does not
find in the current directory. cscope uses a symbol cross-reference,
cscope.out by default, to locate functions, function calls, macros,
variables, and preprocessor symbols in the files.

cscope builds the symbol cross-reference the first time it is used on
the source files for the program being browsed. On a subsequent
invocation, cscope rebuilds the cross-reference only if a source file
has changed or the list of source files is different. When the
cross-reference is rebuilt, the data for the unchanged files are
copied from the old cross-reference, which makes rebuilding faster
than the initial build.
