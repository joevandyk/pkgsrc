CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files.
Right now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing
with all of the .chm files I've come across.  Due to the fairly
well-designed indexing built into this particular file format, even
a small library is able to gain reasonably good performance indexing
into ITSS archives.  Since the last version there have been major
bugfixes, portability improvements, and minor feature additions.
