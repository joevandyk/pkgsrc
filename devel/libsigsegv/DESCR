GNU libsigsegv is a library for handling page faults in user mode. A page
fault occurs when a program tries to access a region of memory that is
currently unavailable. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful
technique for implementing:

* Pageable virtual memory
* Memory-mapped access to persistent databases
* Generational garbage collectors
* Stack overflow handlers
* Distributed shared memory
