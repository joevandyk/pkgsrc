This package provides the -liberty library of "missing" functions.
It is a collection of subroutines used by various GNU programs.
Current members include:

        getopt -- get options from command line
        obstack -- stacks of arbitrarily-sized objects
        strerror -- error message strings corresponding to errno
        strtol -- string-to-long conversion
        strtoul -- string-to-unsigned-long conversion

The functions in liberty are normally included, as needed, by
GNU packages to make up for functions not found in the operating
system.

This copy of liberty has been extracted from the gcc-3.4.0
release distribution.
