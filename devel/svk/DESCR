While Subversion aims to take over the CVS user base, SVK attempts
to take over the others -- including people who are already using
other SCM systems, and people who had not started using SCM.

SVK is written in Perl, using Subversion's underlying filesystem
but provides additional features:

 * Offline operations like "checkin", "log", "merge".
 * Distributed branches.
 * Lightweight checkout copy management (no ".svn" directories).
 * Advanced merge algorithms, like "star-merge" and "cherry picking".
