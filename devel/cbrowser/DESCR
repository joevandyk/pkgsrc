Cbrowser helps manage the recursive process of searching through
source code for usages by providing a history mechanism.  Every query
is recorded and can be recalled at any time, without the need of
re-querying the database.

Cbrowser allows you to build and use multiple source code databases
for individual software projects.  Switching databases is as simple as
selecting the file, and a history of all databases used is kept at all
times.

Best of all, cbrowser provides a hierarchical function viewer.
Functions may be expanded and contracted to show or hide the functions
they call.  The function's code itself is shown in an adjoining
viewer.  This feature is implemented using the megawidget Library by
Jeff Hobbs which luckily for me comes with an unrestricted license.
