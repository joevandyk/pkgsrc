Intel2GAS is a converter that will convert assembler source files written for
NASM to files that can be assembled using the GNU Assembler (GAS), on the i386
platform. It provides support for basic MMX instructions as well.

This converter was written for the Hermes project and is now released to the
general public. The code inside this converter is extremely flexible, you can
write a syntax file to convert between any two assembler languages on a good
day.. :)

Features:
Basic opcodes are done
MMX/FPU support (converts all Hermes files :)
Preliminary Gas2Intel conversion
Conversion from masm/tasm to gnu syntax
