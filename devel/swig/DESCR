SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)

SWIG is a compiler that integrates C and C++ with languages including
Perl, Python, Tcl, Guile, Mzscheme, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Ocaml.

SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code (glue
code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries available to
the listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with a scripting
language.
