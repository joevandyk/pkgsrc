JavaDeps - Automatic Dependency Tracking for Java

Tracking dependencies amongst a group of source files is always a chore.
With Java it's even worse: source files may be mutually-dependent, and
make doesn't deal with this situation at all!

JavaDeps is a tool to generate dependency rules for Java sources, inspired
by the "-MM" flag of gcc. This program analyzes a set of java source
files, and outputs their dependencies, along with makefile rules to build
the resulting classes.
