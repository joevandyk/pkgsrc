Guile-gtk is a library written to make GTK 1.2 accessible from
guile.  It provides a convenient interface for Scheme programmers to
develop visual applications.  It can also integrate with GNOME via the
Gnome-guile module.  (For glib2, see guile-gobject instead.)

Guile-gtk was started by Marius Vollmer <mvo@zagadka.ping.de> and
is currently maintained by Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net> and other
intrepid Guile hackers around the world.

Guile-gtk is free software licensed under the GPL.

This version works with the guile-1.6.x series.
