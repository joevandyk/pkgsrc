Boost is a set of free, peer-reviewed, C++ libraries.  The emphasis is on
portable libraries which work well with the ISO C++ Standard Library.

This package provides all the Boost header files required at build-time
to compile any package that requires Boost.  Binary libraries are provided
in the boost-libs and boost-python packages.
