Set maximum number of concurent users + 1 of the same project.  Example is

Remember for QT3 to work:
	export QTDIR=${PREFIX}/pkg/qt3
	export PATH=${PATH}:${QTDIR}/bin
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${PREFIX}/X11R6/lib:${QTDIR}/lib

Remember that QT3 must have been built with the -no-xft option.
	i.e. build and install "pkgsrc/x11/qt3-libs" with the following line
		CONFIGURE_ARGS+= -no-xft
	added to file
		${PREFIX}/pkgsrc/x11/qt3-libs/Makefile.common

Remember that bouml does not work with QT4.
