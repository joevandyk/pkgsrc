BOUML is a free UML tool box (under development) allowing you to specify and
generate code in C++, Java and Idl. It runs under Unix/Linux/Solaris, MacOS X,
and Windows. Also generates UML elements from code.

This package requires QT3 built with -no-xft.  Bouml does not work with QT4.

QT3 must be built with the -no-xft option because the QT3 package has
been configured to depend on Xft2.  When QT3 opens a font, the font size is
wrong, and the following message is given to the console:"couldn't open
fontconfigs chosen font with Xft!!!"  Until the relationship between QT3,
fontconfigs, and Xft2 is resolved, use the -no-xft option.  i.e. Prior to
building bouml, build and install "pkgsrc/x11/qt3-libs" with the following
line
	CONFIGURE_ARGS+= -no-xft
added to
	pkgsrc/x11/qt3-libs/Makefile.common
