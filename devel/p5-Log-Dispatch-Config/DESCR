Log::Dispatch::Config is a subclass of Log::Dispatch and provides a way
to configure Log::Dispatch object with configulation file (default, in
AppConfig format). This is similar to the way that Java log4j works.

What you do is call "configure" method once in somewhere (like
"startup.pl" in mod_perl), then you can get configured dispatcher
instance via "Log::Dispatch::Config->instance".
