The two perl items in this package are an stty shell script and a
module for setting terminal parameters. to use the Stty.pm module stuff it in
your $PERL_LIB_DIR/site_perl/IO directory. In your scripts do:

     use IO::Stty;
     IO::Stty::stty(\*TTYHANDLE, @modes);

This has not been tailored to the IO::File stuff but will work with it as
indicated. Before you go futzing with term parameters it's a good idea to grab
the current settings and restore them when you finish.
