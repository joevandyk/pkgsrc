  libstash is a collection of programming support routines and
useful algorithms that was developed in the course of the SQRL
project.

  libstash implements a number of algorithms such as hash tables,
lists, rings, trees, and binomial heaps.  A somewhat unique
implementation of reference-counted arbitrary buffers simplifies
streaming data.

  There is an extensible printf replacement that makes printing
user-defined types (such as the buffers mentioned above) as clean
as printing built-in types. There are memory allocation and thread
wrappers, various aids to threaded programming such as message
queues, specialized memory allocation facilities, and lots of
debugging aids that help detect many common memory-related errors.

  libstash comes with a BSD style licence (without the advertising
clause).
