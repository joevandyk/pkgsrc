ITS4 -- It's the software, stupid! (Security Scanner)

ITS4 is a tool that statically scans C and C++ source code for
potential security vulnerabilities.  It is a command-line tool that
works across Unix environments (hopefully) and will also work under
Windows with CygWin installed.  ITS4 scans code, looking for function
calls that are potentially dangerous.  For some calls, ITS4 tries to
perform some code analysis to determine how risky the call is.  In
each case, ITS4 provides a problem report, including a short
description of the potential problem and suggestions on how to fix the
code.
