Libaura is a library of Assorted Useful Reusable Abstractions -
data structures and utilities for C language programming.  At
present, they include:

- memory allocators/deallocators
- key<->value dictionaries (hashed or sorted)
- extensible buffers
- filesystem predicates (is_dir, is_named_pipe, etc)
- popen() variation which allows the caller to know the pid of
  the process on the other end of the pipe.
