StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.

Note that StGIT is not an SCM interface on top of GIT and it expects a
previously initialised GIT repository (unless it is cloned using StGIT
directly). For standard SCM operations, either use plain GIT commands
or the Cogito tool but it is not recommended to mix them with the
StGIT commands.
