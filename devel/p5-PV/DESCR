I needed a basic text-mode GUI framework to implement some
nice-looking proggies on Linux. Didn't find any around, so necessity
became the mother of PerlVision. And this beast kept growing as I made
love to Perl, so now it's far from 'basic'. Provides 90% of the
features you'd want for a user interface, including checkboxes,
radiobuttons, three different styles (!) of pushbuttons, single and
multiple selection listboxes, an extensible editbox that does
autowrapping, a scrollable viewbox, single line text entry fields, a
menubar with pulldown menus, and full popup dialog boxes with multiple
controls.
