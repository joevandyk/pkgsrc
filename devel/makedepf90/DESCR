Makedepf90 is a program for automatic creation of Makefile dependency
lists for Fortran source code.  Makedepf90 supports MODULE:s,
INCLUDE:s, cpp #include:s, f90ppr $include:s and coco ??include:s and
set-files.

The original idea was to provide the same functionality for Fortran as

    gcc -MM *.c

does for C.
