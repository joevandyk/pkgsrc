ht is a file viewer, editor and analyzer for text, binary, and (especially)
executable files.  It recognizes the most common executable formats, like
COFF, ELF, LE, MZ, NE, PE32, PE64 and Java .class files, and can disassemble
them.

It can also find branch sources and destinations recursively, find procedure
entries, creates labels based on this information, create xref information,
interactively analyse unexplored code, create/rename/delete labels and
create/edit comments.
