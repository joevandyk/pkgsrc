The  kjbuckets  module  defines  three  data  types for Python: kjSet,
kjGraph,  and  kjDict.  These  types  come with a number of associated
methods,  including  common  set theoretical operations such as union,
intersection,  difference,  composition,  transposition,  reachability
sets, and transitive closure.

For  suitably  large compute intensive uses these types should provide
up to an order of magnitude speedup versus an implementation that uses
analogous operations implemented directly in Python.
