The MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage
of shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes
under Unix platforms. On the first (lower) layer it hides all platform
dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing with
shared memory segments and on the second (higher) layer it provides a
high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well known way to work
with data-structures inside those shared memory segments.
