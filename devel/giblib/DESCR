  Giblib is a utility library used by many of the applications found on
www.linuxbrit.co.uk.  It incorporates doubly linked lists, some string
functions, and a wrapper for imlib2.  The wrapper does two things.  It
gives you access to fontstyles, which can be loaded from files, saved to
files, or defined dynamically through the API.  It also, and more
importantly, wraps imlib2's context API into a more compact form.
