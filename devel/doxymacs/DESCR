The purpose of the Doxymacs project is to create a LISP package that will make
using Doxygen from within {X}Emacs easier.

Doxymacs has the following features:

  * ability to look up documentation for symbols from {X}Emacs in the browser
    of your choice.

  * easily insert Doxygen style comments into source.

  * optionally use an "external" (i.e. written in C) XML parser to speed up
    building the completion list.

  * fontify Doxygen keywords.
