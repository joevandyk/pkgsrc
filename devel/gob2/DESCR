  GObject Builder (for glib2) is a simple preprocessor for easily
creating GObject objects.  It does not parse any C code and ignores
any C errors.  It is in spirit similar to things like lex or yacc.  In
some ways it also resembles java.  But it is really just a simple
preprocessor for creating GObjects for use in C or C++ and it is not a
programming language.
