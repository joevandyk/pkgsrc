  The Eazel Extensions Library is a collection of widgets and extensions
to many modules of the GNOME platform.  These widgets and extensions
were developed by hackers working on Nautilus.  For the duration of
the Nautilus 1.0 development cycle, the code was internal to Nautilus
and its components.

  In order to clearly distinguish useful extensions that could be useful
for other projects, we have decided to put them in their own library.
It is possible that we will move even more from Nautilus to Eel in the
future.
