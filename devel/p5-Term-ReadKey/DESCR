The ReadKey module provides ioctl control for terminals so the input
modes can be changed (thus allowing reads of a single character at a
time), and also provides non-blocking reads of stdin, as well as several
other terminal related features, including retrieval/modification of the
screen size, and retrieval/modification of the control characters.
