This Perl 5 module can build the C portions of Perl modules by
invoking the appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform
manner.  It was motivated by the "Module::Build" project, but may
be useful for other purposes as well.  However, it is not intended
as a general cross-platform interface to all your C building
needs.
