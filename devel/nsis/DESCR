NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a professional open-source tool
for the development of Windows installers.  It is designed to be as small and
flexible as possible and is therefore highly suitable for Internet
distribution.

An installer is not only the first experience of a user has with your product,
many software problems can also be solved by providing reliable installation
tools.  NSIS allows you to create stable, quick and user friendly installers
that are capable of installing, uninstalling, setting system settings,
extracting files and more.  With the NSIS scripting language you can implement
any custom logic you want.

The large collection of plug-ins, scripts and software in the Developer Center
helps you to build full featured installers and provides a solution for almost
every scenario.
