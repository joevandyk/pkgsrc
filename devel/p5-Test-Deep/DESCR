Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result
you got is the result you were expecting. At its simplest it compares
two structures by going through each level, ensuring that the values
match, that arrays and hashes have the same elements and that
references are blessed into the correct class. It also handles
circular data structures without getting caught in an infinite
loop.

Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something
besides simple exact comparisons. With strings, the = operator
checks that 2 strings are exactly equal but sometimes that's not
what you want. When you don't know exactly what the string should
be but you do know some things about how it should look, = is no
good and you must use pattern matching instead. Test::Deep provides
pattern matching for complex data structures.
