This is the source directory for the GNU emacs lisp library Elib
version 1.0.  Elib is designed to be for Elisp programs what libg++ is
for C++ programs:  a collection of useful routines which don't have to
be reinvented each time a new program is written.

Elib contains code for:
 - container data structures (queues, stacks, AVL trees, etc)
 - string handling functions missing in standard emacs
 - minibuffer handling functions missing in standard emacs
 - routines for handling lists of so called cookies in a buffer.
