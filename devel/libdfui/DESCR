libdfui is a LIBrary for DragonFly User Interfaces.  It provides a highly
abstract user interaction interface with which an application program
(termed the backend) can communicate with a user via a concreate user
interface terminal program (termed the frontend.)  The frontend and the
backend can communicate over several kinds of transport layers (TCP,
CAPS, and Named Pipes.)  The protocol is abstract enough so that the
frontend can occupy nearly any medium (GUI, addressable text console,
teletype, voice synthesis/recognition, etc) with little to no `fudging'
of the semantics (i.e. the structure and nature of the information that
the backend wishes to present and/or acquire.)
