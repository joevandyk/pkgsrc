You must now do post-installation configuration:

(1) Make sure your database server is running.

(2) Edit @RT_PATH@/etc/config.pm to suit your preferences.

(3) Run rtconfig (located in @RT_PATH@/etc) to set up the database.

(4) Ensure /var/pkg/rt/sessiondata is writable as the user under which your
    web server runs.

(5) Read the README.rt file located in the same directory as this
file.  This covers issues such as how to configure your web server
for use with rt, how to set up aliases for the email gateway, and
cron jobs for cleaning out stale data.

If you are using Apache you will need to install www/ap-fastcgi, and
the following may prove useful to avoid an issue with the POST from
the initial Login screen being ignored:

    LoadModule perl_module lib/httpd/mod_perl.so
    LoadModule fastcgi_module lib/httpd/mod_fastcgi.so
    AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi
    #
    <VirtualHost YOUR_SERVER_NAME>
	ServerName YOUR_SERVER_NAME
	DocumentRoot @RT_PATH@/WebRT/html
	PerlModule Apache::DBI
	PerlRequire @RT_PATH@/bin/webmux.pl
	FastCgiServer @RT_PATH@/bin/mason_handler.fcgi
	Alias /NoAuth/images/ @RT_PATH@/WebRT/html/NoAuth/images/
	ScriptAlias / @RT_PATH@/bin/mason_handler.fcgi/
    </VirtualHost>
