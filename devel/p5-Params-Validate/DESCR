The Params::Validate module provides a flexible system for validation
method/function call parameters.  The validation can be as simple
as checking for the presence of required parameters or as complex
as validating object classes (via isa) or capabilities (via can),
checking parameter types, and using customized callbacks to ensure
data integrity.
