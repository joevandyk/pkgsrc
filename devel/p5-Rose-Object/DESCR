Rose::Class is a generic base class for classes. It provides a
single class method (error), but may be expanded further in the
future.

A class that inherits from Rose::Class is not expected to allow
objects of that class to be instantiated, since the namespace for
class and object methods is shared. For example, it is common for
Rose::Object-derived classes to have error methods, but this would
conflict with the Rose::Class method of the same name.
