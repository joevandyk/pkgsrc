The Stanford GraphBase is a highly portable collection of programs and
data for researchers who study combinatorial algorithms and data
structures.  All files are in the public domain and usable with only
one restriction: They must not be changed! A ``change file'' mechanism
allows local customization while the master files stay intact.

The programs are intended to be interesting in themselves as examples
of ``literate programming.''  Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be
regarded as a collection of approximately 30 essays for programmers to
enjoy reading, whether or not they are doing algorithmic research.
The programs are written in CWEB, a combination of TeX and C that is
easy to use by anyone who knows those languages and easy to read by
anyone familiar with the rudiments of C.
