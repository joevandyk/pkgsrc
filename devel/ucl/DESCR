UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It implements a number of NRV compression algorithms that achieve an
excellent compression ratio while allowing very fast decompression.

Compared to LZO, the UCL algorithms achieve a better compression ratio
but decompression is a little bit slower.
