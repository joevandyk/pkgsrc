This is a library in ANSI C for manipulation of balanced binary
trees.  Functions for use with three varieties of AVL tree and
one type of red-black tree are included.  There is full documentation,
including an explanation of what AVL and red-black trees are and why
you'd use them, in Texinfo, Info, HTML, and plain text formats.
