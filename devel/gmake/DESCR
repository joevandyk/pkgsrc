Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and
how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you
should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make
to build and install the program.

This is the GNU version of make.
