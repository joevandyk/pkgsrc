tmake is an easy-to-use tool from Trolltech to create and maintain
makefiles for software projects.  It can be a painful task to manage
makefiles manually, especially if you develop for more than one platform
or use more than one compiler.  tmake automates and streamlines this
process and lets you spend your valuable time on writing code, not
makefiles.

Our main motivation for developing tmake was that we spent far too much
time maintaining makefiles for Qt,
our cross-platform GUI toolkit. Qt supports around 15 flavors of Unix,
Microsoft Windows, and around 15 different C++ compilers.  We looked at
GNU autoconf, but it was Unix-specific and not flexible enough in our
opinion. Our makefile system also had to deal with Qt meta object compiler
(moc) issues. The moc program extracts meta information from C++ files and
generates a C++ file with data tables etc.  It takes extra work to add
makefile rules for the moc and wanted to automate this task.
