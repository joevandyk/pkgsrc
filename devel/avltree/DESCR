AVLtree is a small, malloc-based, in-memory index package generally
like B-trees and hash tables. The interface resembles that of the BPLUS
(B-tree) index package.

Index creation options are:

  - fixed-length binary keys OR variable-length string keys
  - unique OR duplicate keys
  - with duplicate keys:
      standard (void *) pointers for each key OR
      instance-counting (saves time and memory)

Key insert/search time is O(log N).  References:
