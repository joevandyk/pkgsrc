Patchutils is a small collection of programs that operate on patch files.
Interdiff generates an incremental patch from two patches against a common
source. For example, if you have applied a pre-patch to a source tree, and
wish to apply another pre-patch (which is against the same original source
tree), you can use interdiff to generate the patch that you need to apply.
You can also use this to review changes between two pre-patches.
Combinediff generates a single patch from two incremental patches, allowing
you to merge patches together. The resulting patch file only alters each file
once.
Filterdiff will select the portions of a patch file that apply to files
matching (or, alternatively, not matching) a shell wildcard.
Fixcvsdiff is for correcting the output of 'cvs diff'.
Rediff corrects hand-edited patches, by comparing the original patch with the
modified one and adjusting the offsets and counts.
Lsdiff displays a short listing of affected files in a patch file, along with
(optionally) the line numbers of the start of each patch.
Splitdiff separates out patches from a patch file so that each new patch file
only alters any given file once. In this way, a file containing several
incremental patches can be split into individual incremental patches.
Grepdiff displays a list of the files modified by a patch where the patch
contains a given regular expression.
Recountdiff fixes up counts and offsets in a unified diff.
Unwrapdiff fixes word-wrapped unified diffs.
