Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer.
Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both
assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or
other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source code
editors and IDEs.

There is a tutorial introduction to check at

    http://check.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html

This includes a brief comparison of check with other C unit test
frameworks, such as GNU Autounit, cUnit, and CUnit.

Check was inspired by similar frameworks that currently exist for most
programming languages; the most famous example being JUnit for Java
(www.junit.org). There is a list of unit test frameworks for multiple
languages at www.xprogramming.com/software.htm .
