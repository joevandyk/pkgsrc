These are the libraries from Rob Mars' HFS Utilities. These libraries
provide routines for programs to access HFS (Apple Macintosh) partitions,
including routines to access and manipulate "resource forks".

The HFS Utilities command line tools and GUI themselves may be found
in the sysutils/hfsutils and sysutils/xhfs packages, respectively.
