This module prototypes the Perl 6 'exported' and 'exportable' traits
in Perl 5.

Instead of messing around with @EXPORT arrays, you just declare which subs
are to be exported (or are exportable on request) as part of those subs.

For example:

	sub foo is exported {		# by default
		...
	}

	sub bar is exportable {		# on request
		...
	}
