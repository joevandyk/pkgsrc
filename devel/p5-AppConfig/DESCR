AppConfig is a bundle of perl5 modules for parsing configuration files
and command line arguments.  It has a very powerful configuration file
processor and a simple, efficient mechanism for parsing command line
arguments.  It also will use the Getopt::Long module where available
to extend its own command line parsing abilities.
