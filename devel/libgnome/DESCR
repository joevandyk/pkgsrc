libgnome is the library that provides access to the non-X11 dependent
parts of the GNOME framework. The libraries in this directory do not
need to link with any GUI library.

  This package is part of the GNOME 2 Development Platform.

  The GNOME 2 Desktop is a greatly improved user environment for existing
GNOME applications.  Enhancements include anti-aliased text and first class
internationalisation support, new accessibility features for disabled
users, and many improvements throughout GNOME's highly regarded user
interface.
