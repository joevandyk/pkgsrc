The Getopt::Long module implements an extended getopt function
called GetOptions(). This function adheres to the POSIX syntax for
command line options, with GNU extensions. In general, this means
that options have long names instead of single letters, and are
introduced with a double dash "--". Support for bundling of command
line options, as was the case with the more traditional single-letter
approach, is provided but not enabled by default.
