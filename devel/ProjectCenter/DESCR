  ProjectCenter is meant to be the GNUstep counter part to NeXT's Project
Builder.  Thus, it helps you to start new projects and lets you manage your
project files using a intuitive and well ordered graphical user interface.

  Supporting the project types Application, Bundle, GormApplication,
Library, and Tool.  This great application automatically creates the
project makefiles and aids you in the process of editing, project
compilation, package building and debugging. In the future, built-in CVS
support will be available, too.

  ProjectCenter is already a usable application, but still evolving.
Support is there for project creation and inspection as well as basic
Makefile generation.  Using the GormApplication project type, you can
already create graphical applications using ProjectCenter and Gorm in
conjunction.
