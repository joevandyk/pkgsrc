The Test::Cmd module is a Perl class for writing portable tests of
external commands or scripts. Its key features include portable interfaces
for file system interaction, including management and cleanup of one or
more temporary working directories. This makes it extremely well-suited
for testing programs or systems that rely on specific file system
characteristics (time stamps, permissions, directory structures), yet which
must operate on multiple operating systems.
