Boost is a set of free, peer-reviewed, C++ libraries.  The emphasis is on
portable libraries which work well with the ISO C++ Standard Library.

This package adds static and shared binary libraries for Boost.  All
libraries are included here, except Boost.Python, which can be found in
the boost-python package.
