  This is a specific GCC/GNUstep objective C runtime required by sope,
OpenGroupware.org, and libFoundation.

  The runtime is modeled after the NeXT Objective C runtime.  That is, most
functions have semantics as it is known from the NeXT.  The names, however,
have changed.  All runtime API functions have names of lowercase letters
and underscores as opposed to the `traditional' mixed case names.
