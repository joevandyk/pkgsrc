The Perl 5 module Module::Starter::PBP implements a simple approach
to creating modules and their support files, based on the
Module::Starter module.

When used as a Module::Starter plugin, this module allows you to
specify a simple directory of templates which are filled in with
module-specific information, and thereafter form the basis of your
new module.

The default templates that this module initially provides are based
on the recommendations in the book "Perl Best Practices" (O'Reilly,
2005).
