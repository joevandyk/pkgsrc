Ratfor is a preprocessor for Fortran code that allows the use C-like
flow expressions.  Ratfor was invented by Brian Kernigham.  Statements
on a line may be separated by a ";". Statements may be grouped
together with braces }.  Do loops do not require statement numbers
because {} defines the range, etc.  The Fortran relational operators
.gt.,.ge,.ne., etc. may be written >,<=,!=,etc.  All of these are
translated into Fortran 77 by Ratfor.  Ratfor also frees you from
Fortran's strict indentation rules.  Anything from a # to the end of
the line is a comment.
