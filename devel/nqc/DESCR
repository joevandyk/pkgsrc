Not Quite C is a simple language with a C like syntax that can be used
to program Lego's RCX programmable brick (from the Mindstorms set). If
you are just getting started with programming, then graphical
environments such as the Mindstorms RIS software or Robolab are
probably better choices. If, however, you're a C programmer and prefer
typing a few lines to drag and drop icon programming, then NQC may be
perfect for you.
