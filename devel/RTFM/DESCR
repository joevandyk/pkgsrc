RTFM is an enterprise-grade knowledge management tool that enables an
organization to easily capture and share its employees' knowledge and wisdom.

Just as you use RT (the world's leading open-source ticketing system) to log
tickets and resolve issues, RTFM lets you open, categorize and search for
"articles."  Like RT, RTFM lets your users contribute additional information to
existing articles and makes sure that each article's full history is preserved
for future inspection.  RTFM makes it easy to quickly search the knowledge base
and find critical information.

Key Features:

    * RTFM is built on RT, the leading open-source ticketing system.
    * RTFM uses RT's authentication and authorization systems.
    * RTFM integrates seamlessly with RT.  Companies who are already using RT
      will find it even easier to get RTFM up and running.
