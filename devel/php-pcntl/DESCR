PHP is a programming language designed to be embedded into web pages.
This module provides support for Process Control functions.

Process Control support in PHP implements the Unix style of process
creation, program execution, signal handling and process termination.
Process Control should not be enabled within a webserver environment
and unexpected results may happen if any Process Control functions
are used within a webserver environment.
