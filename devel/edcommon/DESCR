  The EDCommon framework extends Foundation and AppKit in a natural way.
It contains common methods you always need, like removing whitespace around
a string, special collection classes such as stack or object pair, an
object-oriented API for socket programming, some widgets, the chasing
arrows to indicate background activity for example, an XML parser and
other nifty stuff.

  The origins of the EDCommon und EDMessage frameworks date back to 1997
and the original NeXT implementation of the OpenStep standard.  Most of
their components have been thoroughly tested and refined through years of
use in OpenSource as well as in commercial projects.  EDCommon also has
full Apple-style reference documentation for all classes and other APIs.
