The KDevelop IDE has been designed by the KDevelop Team to provide
an easy-to use environment for C/C++ programmers. With all its
features the current version contains, the full amount of programming
knowledge of the team has been collected to add a set of documentation
handbooks that will help beginners as well as experts in various parts
of using their IDE.

This is a meta-package that comprises the actual kdevelop package
plus additional packages likely to be useful when using kdevelop.
