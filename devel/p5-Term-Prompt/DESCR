The Term-Prompt module can be used to accept interactive input.  You specify
the type of inputs allowed, a prompt, help text and defaults and it will deal
with the user interface, (and the user!), by displaying the prompt, showing the
default, and checking to be sure that the response is one of the legal choices.
Additional "types" that could be added would be a phone type, a social security
type, a generic numeric pattern type...
