OpenCM is designed as a secure, high-integrity replacement for CVS. A
list of the key features can be found on the features page
(http://www.opencm.org/features.html). While not as ``feature rich''
as CVS, it supports some useful things that CVS lacks. Briefly, OpenCM
provides first-class support for renames and configuration,
cryptographic authentication and access control, and first-class
branches.
