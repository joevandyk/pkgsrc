The BuDDy Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) library presented here was made
as part of a ph.d. project on model checking of finite state machines.
The library has evolved from a simple introduction to BDDs to a full blown
BDD package with all the standard BDD operations, reordering and a wealth
of documentation.
