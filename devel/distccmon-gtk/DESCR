distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
two or more times faster than a local compile.

distcc does not require all machines to share a filesystem, have
synchronized clocks, or to have the same libraries or header files
installed. Machines can be running different operating systems, as long
as they have compatible binary formats or cross-compilers.

This package provides a graphical monitor for distcc, much like
distccmon-text but based on GTK+.
