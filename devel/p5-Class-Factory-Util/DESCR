Class::Factory:Util contains methods that are useful for factory
classes.

When this module is loaded, it creates a method in its caller
named subclasses().  This method returns a list of the available
subclasses for the package.  It does this by looking in the
library directory containing the caller, and finding any modules
in its immediate subdirectories.
