  Libglade is a library that performs a similar job to the C source
output routines in the GLADE user interface builder.   Whereas GLADE's
output routines create C code that can then be compiled, libglade builds
the interface from an XML file (GLADE's save format) at runtime.  This
way you can change the look of a program without needing to recompile.

  Currently it supports all the widgets in current releases, together
with support for keyboard accelerators and automatic signal
connection.
