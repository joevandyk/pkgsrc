ALD is an Assembly Language Debugger written by Patrick Alken. It's
released under the GPL and has a familiar feel to it if you're used
to GDB. Primary features include stepping, tracing, disassembly, a
nice curses-based display, breakpoints, temporary breakpoints, and
some library abstractions that people can use in their own software.

This package is x86 only at the moment.
