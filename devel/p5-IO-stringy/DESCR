  This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
and object-oriented i/o) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

  This Perl module provides the following functions :

        IO::AtomicFile     Write a file which is updated atomically
        IO::Lines          I/O handle to read/write to array of lines
        IO::Scalar         I/O handle to read/write to a string
        IO::ScalarArray    I/O handle to read/write to array of scalars
        IO::Wrap           Wrap old-style FHs in standard OO interface
        IO::WrapTie        Tie your handles & retain full OO interface
