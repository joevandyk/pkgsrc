This module allows you to run a subprocess and redirect stdin, stdout,
and/or stderr to files and perl data structures. It aims to satisfy
99% of the need for using system, qx, and open3 with a simple,
extremely Perlish API and none of the bloat and rarely used features
of IPC::Run.
Speed, simplicity, and portability are paramount. (That's speed of
Perl code; which is often much slower than the kind of buffered I/O
that this module uses to spool input to and output from the child
command.) Disk space is not.
