etrace: A run-time tracing tool
-------------------------------
These source files comprise a simple but efficient utility that allows the
display of a function call tree in a C program at run-time. It is also
possible to dump the results of a program execution to an ASCII file for
later examination.

* ptrace.c compiles your code to enable this run-time tracing
* etrace is a Python script that will perform the run-time tracing by
displaying the function names as they are called
* etrace.pl is a Perl script that will perform the run-time tracing by
displaying the function names as they are called. Moreover, etrace.pl
can be used to trace dynamic libraries.
