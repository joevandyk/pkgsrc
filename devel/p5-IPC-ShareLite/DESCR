IPC::ShareLite provides a simple interface to shared memory, allowing
data to be efficiently communicated between processes.

It provides an abstraction of the shared memory and semaphore facilities
of SysV IPC, allowing the storage of arbitrarily large data; the module
automatically acquires and removes shared memory segments as needed.
Storage and retrieval of data is atomic, and locking functions are
provided for higher-level synchronization.

In many respects, this module is similar to IPC::Shareable. However,
IPC::ShareLite does not provide a tied interface, does not (automatically)
allow the storage of variables, and is written in C for additional speed.
