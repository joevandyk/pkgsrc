The Perl 5 module Object::InsideOut provides comprehensive support
for implementing classes using the inside-out object model.

It implements inside-out objects as anonymous scalar references
that are blessed into a class with the scalar containing the ID
for the object (usually a sequence number).  Object data (i.e.,
fields) are stored within the class's package in either arrays
indexed by the object's ID, or hashes keyed to the object's ID.

The virtues of the inside-out object model over the 'blessed hash'
object model have been extolled in detail elsewhere.  Briefly,
inside-out objects offer the following advantages over 'blessed
hash' objects:
* Encapsulation
* Field Name Collision Avoidance
* Compile-time Name Checking
