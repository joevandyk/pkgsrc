PWLib is a moderately large class library that has its genesis
many years ago as a method to product applications to run on both
Microsoft Windows and Unix X-Windows systems.

Since then the system has grown to having quite good application
to areas other than mere Windows GUI portability. Classes for I/O
portability, multi-threading portability, aid in producing unix
daemons and NT services portably and all sorts of internet protocols
were added over the years.

All this over and above basic "container" classes such as arrays,
linear lists, sorted lists (RB Tree) and dictionaries (hash tables)
which were all created before STL became the answer to all our prayers.
