PRCS's purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according
to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those
systems.

The current release, version 1.0, and future releases of PRCS can be
found at ftp://XCF.Berkeley.EDU/pub/prcs.  HTML documentation and
recent developments are available online at the home page.

PRCS is released under the GNU public license, see the file COPYING
for details.

Bug reports can be addressed to the following address:
