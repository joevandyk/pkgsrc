The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that
is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community. The software
is released under an Apache/BSD-style open source license.

This package contains the Python bindings to the Subversion libraries
and some programs that use them.  This includes cvs2svn, which
converts CVS repositories to Subversion repositories.
