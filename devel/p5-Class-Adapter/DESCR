The Perl 5 module Class::Adapter is intended as an abstract base
class for creating any sort of class or object that follows the
Adapter pattern.  An Adapter in this Perl sense of the term is when
a class is created to achieve by composition (objects containing
other object) something that can't be achieved by inheritance
(sub-classing).
