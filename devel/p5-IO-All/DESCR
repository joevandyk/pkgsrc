IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single Spiffy
object oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO
idioms.  It exports a single function called "io", which returns a
new IO::All object.  And that object can do it all!

The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket,
IO::String, Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards;
as well as all the DBM and MLDBM modules.  You can use most of the
methods found in these classes and in IO::Handle (which they inherit
from).  IO::All adds dozens of other helpful idiomatic methods including
file stat and manipulation functions.
