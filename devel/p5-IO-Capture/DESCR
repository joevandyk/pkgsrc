IO::Capture defines an abstract base class that can be used to create
any number of useful sub-classes that capture output being sent on a
filehandle such as STDOUT or STDERR.  Several modules come with the
distribution that define sub-classes of IO::Capture to do just that,
i.e., capture STDOUT and STDERR.
