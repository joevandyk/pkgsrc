A lightweight scripting language based on ANSI C.  The language uses a
syntax and library similar to that of ANSI C, but adds automatic
memory management and runtime polymorphism on top of that.

The Arena language was designed with the following main features in
mind, most of which were added on top of a very C-like core to support
better ad-hoc scripting:

     * syntax similar to ANSI C
     * standard library similar to ANSI C
     * automatic memory management
     * runtime polymorphism
     * support for exceptions
     * support for anonymous functions

Additionally, an interpreter for the Arena language can be implemented
to be very compact in terms of both source code size and memory
consumption.
