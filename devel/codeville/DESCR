Why yet another version control system? All other version control systems
require that you keep careful track of the relationships between branches so
as not have to repeatedly merge the same conflicts. Codeville is much more
anarchic. It allows you to update from or commit to any repository at any time
with no unnecessary re-merges.
Codeville works by creating an identifier for each change which is done, and
remembering the list of all changes which have been applied to each file and
the last change which modified each line in each file. When there's a conflict,
it checks to see if one of the two sides has already been applied to the other
one, and if so makes the other side win automatically. When there's an actual
not automatically mergeable version conflict, Codeville behaves in almost
exactly the same way as CVS.
