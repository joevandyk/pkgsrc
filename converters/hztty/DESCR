This program turns a tty session from one encoding to another.
For example, running hztty on cxterm can allow you to read/write
Chinese in HZ format, which was not supported by cxterm.
If you have many applications in different encodings but your
favor terminal program only supports one, hztty can make life easy.
For example, hztty can convert your GB cxterm into a HZ terminal, a
Unicode (16bit, or UTF8, or UTF7) terminal, or a Big5 terminal.
