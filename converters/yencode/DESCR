This is yencode, an encoder/decoder package for the Usenet "yEnc"
format, licensed under the GNU General Public License.

* The encoder can output single part or multipart yencoded
  archives of any size.

* Smart decoder can handle multiple files, including files
  specified out of order or with nonsense file names.

* Easy to use Usenet posting software enables one-liner
  posting of individual files or groups of files, including creation
  of SFV/CRC checksum files if desired.

* Optional scan mode: automatically locate and decode
  single or multipart yencoded archives in specified directories
  or recursively.

* Fully compliant with all versions of the yEnc
  specification (currently v1, v2, v3).

* Properly implements CRC values, including the pcrc32 on
  each part of multipart archives, and a crc32 for the last part
  of a multipart archive.
