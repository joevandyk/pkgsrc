2vcard is a little perl script to convert an addressbook to the popular
VCARD file format. Currently, 2vcard can convert mutt's and mh's alias as
well as pine's, abook's and juno's addressbook format.

The VCARD format is used by gnomecard, for example, which in turn is used
by the balsa email client.
