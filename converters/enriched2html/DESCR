To quote from the author, Brandon Long:

	This program is based on the program in Appendix A of rfc1896.
	It does as much as I can think of to convert text/enriched to
	text/html (since there are so many viewers for text/html).  It
	is a hack.  It is not perfect, and the html it generates is
	far from perfect.  I've tried to follow HTML v3.2, but its
	still not great.

	Usage:
	 Pass it the text/enriched body of a message on stdin, and it
	 will put the text/html version on stdout.

To make mutt display text/enriched, put this in your .mailcap file:

# enriched.sh converts text/enriched to text/html and then uses lynx to display
text/enriched;  ${PREFIX}/bin/enriched2html | lynx -dump -stdin ; copiousoutput
