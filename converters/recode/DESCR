The `recode' library converts files between character sets and usages.
It recognises or produces more than 300 different character sets and
transliterates files between almost any pair.  When exact transliteration
are not possible, it gets rid of offending characters or falls back
on approximations.  The `recode' program is a handy front-end to
the library.
