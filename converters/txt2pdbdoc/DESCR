txt2pdbdoc is a Unix-based Text-to-Doc file conversion program.  (It
also converts Doc files to plain text.)  A Doc file is a defacto
standard file format for text documents for PalmOS document reader
applications.  The motivation for writing txt2pdbdoc was that such
software at the time was crufty and poorly documented.  In contrast,
txt2pdbdoc is well written and well documented.  Unix-style "man"
pages are included for the program, utility scripts, and the Doc file
format itself.  The source code is also generously commented.
