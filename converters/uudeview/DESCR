This is a powerful program at which you can throw a mess of
unordered files in any of BinHex, uuencoded, xxencoded, or
Base64 formats and expect them all to be properly decoded.
It even handles encodings that have been garbled by some
versions of Netscape/MS Explorer or that are missing some parts!

It is also able to encode in all of the above formats except for
BinHex.
