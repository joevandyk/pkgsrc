A set of programs to interconvert between mac font formats
and pfb, ttf, otf and bdf files on unix.

Dealing with mac fonts is hard on other operating systems because
mac fonts are stored in the resource fork, and other operating
systems do not support this concept. Fondu will extract the resource
fork from either a macbinary file or a binhex file. Ufond will
create a resource fork inside a macbinary file.
