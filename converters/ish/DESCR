ish is a format to encode binary files to text file, or decode text
files into binary file.  ish has strong error correction/detection
functionality using CRC and checksum.
This format is popular in Japanese BBS'es.

To non-Japanese people:
	To produce non-Japanese text a user should use "-s7" option.
	Other options such as "-ss" may produce Japanese text.
To Japanese people:
	To use ish over NetNews newsgroups (such as fj.*), use "-s7" option.
	Use of "-ss" will not give you the optimal performance.
	"-ss" option is just for BBSes that use Shift-JIS as their native
	Japanese encoding.
