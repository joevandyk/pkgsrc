Tex2RTF is a program written by Julian Smart (julian.smart@ukonline.co.uk)
to convert from a LaTeX subset to four other formats:
    * Linear RTF, for importing into a wide range of word processors.
    * Windows Help hypertext RTF, for compilation with HC (Help Compiler).
    * HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), as used on the World Wide Web.
    * XLP wxHelp format (the wxWidgets toolkit help format).
