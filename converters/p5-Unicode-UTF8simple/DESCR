Unicode::UTF8simple - Conversions to/from UTF8 from/to charactersets

This utf-8 converter is written in plain perl and works with hopefully
any perl 5 version. It was mainly written because more recent modules
such as Encode do not work under older Perl 5.0 installations.

Supported encodings:
euc-kr
gb2312
iso-8859-1
iso-8859-2
iso-8859-9
koi8-r
utf-8
windows-1256
