You will need to also install print/ghostscript-esp{,-nox11} if you wish
to print to non-Postscript printers.

You may install additional PPD files for other printer models into
${PREFIX}/share/cups/model.

You may want to backup /etc/printcap before starting CUPS for the first
time, as the CUPS scheduler may overwrite this file with automatically
generated content.
