Prosper is a LaTeX class for writing transparencies.  It is written on
top of the seminar class by Timothy Van Zandt.  It aims at offering an
environment for easily creating slides for both presentations with an
overhead projector and a video projector.  Slides prepared for a
presentation with a computer and a video projector may integrate
animation effects, incremental display, and such.
