The program html2ps converts HTML to PostScript. The  HTML
code  can  be  retrieved  from  one or more URL:s or local
files, specified as parameters on the command line.  If no
parameter is given, html2ps reads from standard input.

Note:  To  avoid  unnecessary  network  traffic,  one  can
rebuild an already  generated  PostScript  file  with  new
options.  This  is  done  by  running html2ps with the new
options, and with the old PostScript file  as  input  (not
applicable for all options).
