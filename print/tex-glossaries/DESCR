The glossaries package supports acronyms and multiple glossaries.
New entries are defined to have a name and description (and optionally
an associated symbol).  Plural forms can also be specified.  New
glossary styles can be defined, and preambles and postambles can be
specified.  There is provision for loading a database of terms: only
terms used in the text will be added to the relevant glossary.
