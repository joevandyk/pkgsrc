Latex-Mk is a set of makefile fragments and shell scripts designed
to assist in the management of LaTeX documents.  The user creates
a simple Makefile which sets up a few simple variables and then
includes the latex.mk fragment at the end.

LaTeX-Mk provides easy targets such as 'view', 'pdf', 'print',
and 'clean'.  Additional features such as multiple top level
documents with some shared and some unique dependencies and
draft watermark output are included.

LaTeX-Mk works with BSD make and also with GNU make.
