IJS is a client-server protocol for transmission of raster page images.
This package provides a reference implementation of the protocol, the
design of which is still in flux.  When the protocol specification is
published, it will be authoritative.  Applications should feel free to
link against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for
their own needs, or roll a completely new implementation.
