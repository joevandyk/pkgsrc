The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation
of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on the LPRng-core and LPRng-doc packages.
Its purpose is to require dependencies so users can install this package
only and have the complete LPRng software pulled in by the package
dependency mechanism.
