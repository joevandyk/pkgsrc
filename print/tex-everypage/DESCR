The "everypage" package extends LaTeX providing hooks to perform
actions on every page or on the current page. Specifically, actions
are performed after the page is composed, but before it is shipped,
so they can be used to prepare the output page in tasks like putting
watermarks in the background, setting the next page layout, etc.
