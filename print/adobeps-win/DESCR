Adobe PostScript printer drivers for MS Windows 9x/NT to use CUPS as a
networked PostScript RIP (raster image processor), handling printfiles

consolidate on a single PostScript driver, even for many different target
printers.

Please see the Samba and CUPS documentation for more information on how
to set this up.
