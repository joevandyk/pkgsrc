rlpr is a package that makes it possible (or at the very least, easier),
to print files on remote sites to your local printer.  The rlpr
package includes BSD-compatible replacements for `lpr', `lpq', and
`lprm', whose functionality is a superset of their BSD counterparts.
In other words, with the rlpr package, you can do everything you can
do with the BSD printing commands, and more.  The programs contained
within the rlpr package are all GPL'd, and are more lightweight,
cleaner and more secure than their BSD counterparts.
