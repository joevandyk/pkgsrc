This package provides fonts and macro to typeset Go diagrams.  It is
based on the package go written in 1991 which provides typesetting
facilities for Go games and positions.  Although igo contains roughly
the same commands as the original package and uses the fonts, it has
been improved in a number of ways.  It uses command names less likely
to conflict with standard AMS packages.  It allows different board
sizes to be used.  It understands a standardized notation for board
coordinates.  And it provides a facility to work on more than one
board.  Moreover, a few commands were reworked to define positions or
game sequences more conveniently.
