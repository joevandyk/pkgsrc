Here you have the new release of `poster', to scale postscript
images to a larger size, and print them on larger media and/or
tile them to print on multiple sheets.
With respect to the earlier release:
- support is added for foreign (Non European A*) media sizes.
- options for scaling became more flexible
- original restrictions on white margins in your drawing are removed.
For a complete explanation see the accompanying manual.
