-        *   at the start of line is substituted by the last input.

-  This means that the same effect as above can be obtained  in  shorter  form

-        q                        exit abc2ps
-  
-  Note that the -e flag is not needed in the line  '*  1-10'  because  it  is
-  clear that '1-10' is a selector (see above).
-  
-  
-  Another  point  is  that  if  additional  flags  are  used  when   starting
-  interactively,  these  function  as defaults for the interactive mode.  For
-  example, by starting the program with
+        ? shows the last input used;
