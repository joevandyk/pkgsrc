BagpipeTex is a set of MusixTeX macros to typeset bagpipe music.

Bagpipe music is written slightly differently than regular music and
sequences of gracenotes are often viewed as tokens rather than sequences
of individual notes.  These differences make it very difficult to
typeset bagpipe music with plain old MusixTeX.  Therefore BagpipeTeX has
been written by Walt Innes (walt@slac.stanford.edu).  This is a macro
package for use on top of MusixTex, which is itself a macro package for
use with LaTeX.

Once BagpipeTeX is installed, you can then process BagpipeTeX files
exactly the same as you would a regular MusixTeX file.  For example:

	musixtex foo
	musixflx foo
	musixtex foo

This will give you foo.dvi which then can be processed like any other
.dvi.  Use dvips to convert it into a postscript file or print it to a
Postscript printer.  Then ps2pdf may be used to convert the Postscript
file into a PDF file.
