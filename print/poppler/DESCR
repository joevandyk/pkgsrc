This is poppler, a PDF rendering library. It is a fork of the xpdf
3.0 PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.

Poppler provides PDF rendering functionality as a shared library,
to centralize the maintenence effort and to reduce duplicated
effort. And the poppler developers would like to move libpoppler
forward in a number of areas that doesn't fit within the goals of
xpdf.

The GLib wrapper is available in the print/poppler-glib package.
The QT wrapper is available in the print/poppler-qt package.
The PDF utilities are available in the print/poppler-utils package.
