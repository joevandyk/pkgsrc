ikiwiki is a wiki compiler.

It converts wiki pages into html pages suitable for publishing on a
website. Unlike many wikis, ikiwiki does not have its own ad-hoc means
of storing page history, and instead uses an revision control system.

This means you can edit wiki sources in your favourite editor, and
rebuild the website, rather than using an online browser form.
