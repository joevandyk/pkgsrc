  The SOPE package is an extensive set of frameworks (16 frameworks,
~1500 classes) which form a complete Web application server environment.
Besides the Apple WebObjects compatible appserver extended with Zope
concepts, it contains a large set of reusable classes: XML processing
(SAX2, DOM, XML-RPC), MIME/IMAP4 processing, LDAP connectivity, RDBMS
connectivity, and iCalendar parsing.

  The individual frameworks of the package can be used standalone (for
example in Cocoa or GNUstep applications) and do not require the
application server itself.
