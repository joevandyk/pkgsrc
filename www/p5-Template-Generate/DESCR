This module generates TT2 templates.  It can take data
structures and rendered documents together, and deduce
templates that could have performed the transformation.

It is a companion to Template and Template::Extract; their
relationship is shown below:

Template:           ($template + $data) ==> $document   # normal
Template::Extract:  ($document + $template) ==> $data   # tricky
Template::Generate: ($data + $document) ==> $template   # very tricky

This module is considered experimental.
