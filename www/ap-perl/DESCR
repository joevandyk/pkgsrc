The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of the
Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server.  This is achieved by
linking the Perl runtime library into the server and providing an object
oriented Perl interface to the server's C language API.

These pieces are seamlessly glued together by the `mod_perl' server
plugin, making it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl.
In addition, the persistent interpreter embedded in the server avoids the
overhead of starting an external interpreter program and the additional
Perl start-up (compile) time.
