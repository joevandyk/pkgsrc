CookieCrumbler lets you set up cookie-based authentication even
when your user folder does not support cookies.  Zope 2.3.x or
above is required.

Just add a CookieCrumbler instance to the folder where your
acl_users is located.  You can optionally add the login_form,
logged_in, and logged_out DTMLMethods at the same time.
