Thy was designed to be as fast and lightweight as possible. For
speed, she uses sendfile(), and does not fork.

Among the features are name-based virtual hosts, userdir and
directory index support; Range, If-Modified-Since, keep-alive,
on-the-fly compression and of course, CGI, IPv6 and TLS support.

Thy does not require (but can use) a configuration file to run.
