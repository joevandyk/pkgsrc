Nevow is a next-generation web application templating system, based on
the ideas developed in the Twisted Woven package.  Its main focus is
on separating the HTML template from both the business logic and the
display logic, while allowing the programmer to write pure Python code
as much as possible.  It separates your code into 'data' and 'render'
functions, a simplified implementation of traditional MVC.  It has
various parts which can be used individually or as a whole, integrated
web solution:

 * XHTML templates: contain no programming logic, only nodes tagged
   with nevow attributes
 * data/render methods: simplified MVC
 * stan: An s-expression-like syntax for expressing xml in pure python
 * formless: For describing the types of objects which may be passed
   to methods of your classes, validating and coercing string input
   from either web or command-line sources, and calling your methods
   automatically once validation passes
 * freeform: For rendering web forms based on formless type
   descriptions, accepting form posts and passing them to formless
   validators, and rendering
 * error forms in the event validation fails
 * livepage: Cross-browser JavaScript glue for sending client side
   events to the server and server side events to the client after the
   page has loaded, without causing the entire page to refresh
