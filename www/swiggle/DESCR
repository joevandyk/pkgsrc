swiggle is a small command line tool that generates HTML pages, including
thumbnail indexes, for given images (a so called "web gallery").  It's
intended to be easy to use, and since it is written in C, it's quite
speedy.  It uses libjpeg for decompression and compression of images,
libexif for getting EXIF information contained in the images, and it
caches scaled images so that subsequent runs don't need to scale images
again and are faster.  Of course, the original images aren't changed.
