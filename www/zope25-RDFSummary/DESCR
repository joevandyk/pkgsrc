RDFSummary is a product to display content from other web sites
provided they make it available in RSS 0.9, RSS 0.91 or
"RSS 1.0":http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec format.
The benefit of doing it this way is that the data you get is not
encumbered with HTML, giving you more flexibility when applying your
own look and feel.
