DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API)
for the Perl Language. The DBI API Specification defines a set
of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent
database interface independent of the actual database being used.

With this module you can now have your httpd (apache) logs redirected
into a database table for future querying.
