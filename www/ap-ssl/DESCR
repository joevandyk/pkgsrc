This Apache module provides strong cryptography for the Apache 1.3
webserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport
Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols by the help of the Open Source
SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL which is based on SSLeay from Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The mod_ssl package was created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall
and was originally derived from software developed by Ben Laurie
for use in the Apache-SSL HTTP server project.  Additionally it
uses a tool developed by Larry Wall and David MacKenzie for use in
the GNU project of the FSF.
