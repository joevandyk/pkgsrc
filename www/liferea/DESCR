Liferea is a simple FeedReader clone for Unix distributions with GTK2
(GNOME2 is optional).  It is a news aggregator for RSS/RDF feeds which
also supports CDF channels, Atom/Echo/PIE feeds and OCS or OPML
directories.  The problem with FeedReader: for now its only available
for Windows.  There are some projects for GNU/Linux, but no solution
for GTK/GNOME, which does not require Python or Perl.  Liferea tries
to fill this gap.  Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader.
