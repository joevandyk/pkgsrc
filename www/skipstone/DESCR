SkipStone is a Gtk+ Web Browser that embeds Mozilla's rendering component
Gecko. It aims to be light and fast with few dependencies.

SkipStone provides a nice and simple configurable interface, bookmarks and all
of the other mandantory browsing features.

Downloading is handled by SkipDownload by default, a Gtk+ frontend to the
famous web downloading utility wget. However, if you prefer to use other
download utilities / managers, this option is configurable.

Mail and external url handlers are also handled by external applications which
can be configured to the users choice, leaving SkipStone to do what it does
best - browsing.
