HTTP::Cache::Transparent is an implementation of http get that
keeps a local cache of fetched pages to avoid fetching the same
data from the server if it hasn't been updated. The cache is stored
on disk and is thus persistent between invocations.

The http-headers If-Modified-Since and ETag are used to let the
server decide if the version in the cache is up-to-date or not.
