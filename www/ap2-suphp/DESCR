The suPHP Apache module together with suPHP itself provides an easy way
to run PHP scripts with different users on the same server.

It provides security, because the PHP scripts are not run with the
rights of the webserver's user. In addition to that you probably won't
have to use PHP's "safe mode", which applies many restrictions on the
scripts.
