Chimera, Version 2, is a World Wide Web browser that runs under X.
This incarnation, though outwardly similar, is a complete re-write
of the venerable Chimera, Version 1. For one thing, Chimera now uses
the jpeg and png shared libraries. [The old Chimera called external
binaries to render inline images.] Chimera supports jpeg, gif, and
png images, persistent caching, bookmarks, and Chimera may also be
extended using the standard mailcap mechanism.
