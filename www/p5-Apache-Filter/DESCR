These modules provide the ability to chain PerlHandler routines together,
so that the output of one handler/filter becomes the input of the next
handler/filter.  The following Perl modules are known to be "Filter-aware":

     Apache::Registry (using Apache::RegistryFilter)
     Apache::SSI
     Apache::ASP
     HTML::Mason
     Apache::SimpleReplace
