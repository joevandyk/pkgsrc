FastTemplate is a port of the Perl CGI::FastTemplate module to PHP, which
is a very fast implementation of templates using simple variable
interpolation.

Templates are very useful for CGI programming, because adding HTML to your
PHP code clutters your code and forces you to do any HTML modifications.
By putting all of your HTML in separate template files, you can let a
graphic or interface designer change the look of your application without
having to bug you, or let them muck around in your PHP code.
