Apache Rivet is a system for creating dynamic web content via a
programming language integrated with Apache Web Server.  It is
designed to be fast, powerful and extensible, consume few system
resources, be easy to learn, and to provide the user with a platform
that can also be used for other programming tasks outside the web
(GUI's, system administration tasks, text processing, database
manipulation, XML, and so on).  In order to meet these goals, the Tcl
programming language has been chosen to combine with the Apache Web
Server.
