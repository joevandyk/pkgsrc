Visitors is a very fast web log analyzer for Linux, Windows, and
other Unix-like operating systems. It takes as input a web server
log file, and outputs statistics in form of different reports.
The design principles are very different compared to other software
of the same type:

   * No installation required, can process up to 150,000 lines of
     log entries per second in fast computers (20MB/s with my log
     files average length).
   * Designed to be executed by the command line, output html and
     text reports. The text report can be used in pipe to less to
     check web stats from ssh.
   * Support for real time statistics with the Visitors Stream Mode
     introduced with version 0.3.
   * To specify the log format is not needed at all. Works out of
     box with apache and most other web servers with a standard log
     format (see the documentation for more information on the format).
   * It's a portable C program, can be compiled on many different
     systems.
   * The produced html report doesn't contain images or external
     CSS, is self-contained, you can send it by email to users.
   * Visitors is free software (and of course, freeware), under
     the terms of the GPL license. You don't need to pay to use it.
