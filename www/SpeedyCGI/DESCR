SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make them run
much more quickly. A script can be made to to run persistently by changing
the interpreter line at the top of the script from:

    #!${PREFIX}/bin/perl

to

    #!${PREFIX}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/bin/speedy

After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl interpreter
is kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is used to handle
new executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter each time. A very
fast frontend program, written in C, is executed for each request. This fast
frontend then contacts the persistent Perl process, which is usually already
running, to do the work and return the results.
