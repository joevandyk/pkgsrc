   Users can browse the World Wide Web from within Emacs by using
Emacs/W3.  All of the widely used (and even some not very widely used)
URL schemes are supported, and it is very easy to add new methods as the
need arises.

   Emacs/W3 provides some core functionality that can be readily re-used
from any program in Emacs.  Users and other package writers are
encouraged to Web-enable their applications and daily work routines
with the library.

   Emacs/W3 is completely customizable, both from Emacs-Lisp and from
stylesheets.
