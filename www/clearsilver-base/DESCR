Clearsilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral HTML template
system. In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications,
it provides a separation between presentation code and application
logic which makes working with your project easier.

This package contains the base clearsilver infrastructure.  All
other clearsilver modules depend on this, but it is all you need
if you are using clearsilver from C.
