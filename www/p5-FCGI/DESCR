This is a Fast CGI module for perl. It's based on the FCGI module
that comes with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit, but does
not require you to recompile perl.

See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information about fastcgi.
Lincoln D. Stein's perl CGI module also contains some information
about fastcgi programming.
