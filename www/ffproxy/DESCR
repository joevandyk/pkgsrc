ffproxy is a filtering HTTP/HTTPS proxy server. It is able to filter by
host, URL, and header. Custom header entries can be filtered and added.
It can even drop its privileges and optionally chroot() to some
directory. Logging to syslog() is supported, as is using another
auxiliary proxy server. An HTTP accelerator feature (acting as a
front-end to an HTTP server) is included. Contacting IPv6 servers as
well as binding to IPv6 is supported and allows transparent IPv6 over
IPv4 browsing (and vice versa).
