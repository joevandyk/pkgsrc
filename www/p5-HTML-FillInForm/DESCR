This module automatically inserts data from a previous HTML form
into the HTML input, textarea and select tags.  It is a subclass
of the HTML::Parser manpage and uses it to parse the HTML and insert
the values into the form tags.  One useful application is after a
user submits an HTML form without filling out a required field.
HTML::FillInForm can be used to redisplay the HTML form with all
the form elements containing the submitted info.
