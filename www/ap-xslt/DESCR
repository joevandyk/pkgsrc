mod_xslt is a simple Apache module to serve XML based content. Data
is stored in XML files on the server. The user requests the XML
file and the translation method via a url such as
this:http://localhost/sourcefile.html The module will parse this
URL into a XML source file and an XSL source file. In the example
above, the XML file will be sourcefile.xml. The module will open
sourcefile.xml and determine its DOCTYPE. Based on the DOCTYPE,
the XSL file will be opened. Should the DOCTYPE be "tutorial", the
XSL file opened would be tutorial_html.xsl. The content-type returned
to the browser is text/html. The translation occurs transparently
to the user.
