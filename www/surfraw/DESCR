      Surfraw - Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against the Web
                     http://surfraw.sourceforge.net/

                                 Oh Baybe
                                I need some
                               Deep Linking
                                 Let us go
                            Surfin' in the raw!

  Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
  popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
  google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index, slashdot
  and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands of
  html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix
  heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.
