This module is a bare-bones HTML parser.  It is similar in concept to
HTML::Parser, but it differs in a couple of important ways.

First, HTML::SimpleParse just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it;
it does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
distinguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).

Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags
are inside other pairs of tags.

Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML filter
by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.
