HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents with Python
scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML pages containing information
which changes from time to time. For example, you might want to have a page
which provides an overall system summary of data collected nightly. Or maybe
you have a catalog of data and images that you would like formed into a spiffy
set of web pages for the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language
for these tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects
which are rendered out into consistently structured web pages. Of course, CGI
scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as well.
