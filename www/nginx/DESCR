nginx (pronounced "engine X") is a lightweight web (HTTP) server/reverse proxy
and mail (IMAP/POP3) proxy written by Igor Sysoev.

nginx has been running for more than three years on many heavily loaded Russian
sites including Rambler (RamblerMedia.com).  In March 2007 about 20% of all
Russian virtual hosts were served or proxied by nginx.  According to Google
Online Security Blog nginx serves or proxies about 4% of all Internet virtual
hosts, although Netcraft shows much less percent.
