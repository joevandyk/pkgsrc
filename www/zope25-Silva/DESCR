Silva is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and
management of structured, textual content. Silva allows users to
enter new documents as well as edit existing documents using a web
interface.

Silva stores the content in a structured format (XML), and keeps a
strict separation between the way the content is used and the way it
is presented.
