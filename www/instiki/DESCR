Instiki is a wiki clone with a strong focus on simplicity of
installation and running.  Instiki lowers the barriers of interest for
when you might consider using a wiki.  It is so simple to get running
that you'll find yourself using it for anything -- taking notes,
brainstorming, organizing a gathering, etc.
