Clearsilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral HTML template
system. In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications,
it provides a separation between presentation code and application
logic which makes working with your project easier.

This is a meta-package.  It installs no files, but it depends on
all the clearsilver components.
