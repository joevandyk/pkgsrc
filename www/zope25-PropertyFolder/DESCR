The PropertyFolder is intended mainly for use in conjunction with the
"PropertyObject":http://www.zope.org/Members/mjablonski/PropertyObject and
"AbracadabraObject":http://www.zope.org/Members/mjablonski/AbracadabraObject.
If you got the logic and power behind AbracadabraObject, you will love the
PropertyFolder. If not, you will have no idea what to do with PropertyFolder
at all... but maybe you can use it for other problems as well.
