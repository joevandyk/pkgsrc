The PropertyObject is intended mainly for use in conjunction with the
"PropertyFolder":http://www.zope.org/Members/mjablonski/PropertyFolder and
"AbracadabraObject":http://www.zope.org/Members/mjablonski/AbracadabraObject.
If you got the logic and power behind AbracadabraObject, you will love the
PropertyObject. If not, you will have no idea what to do with PropertyObject
at all... but maybe you can use it for other problems as well.
