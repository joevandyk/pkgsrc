RFC 2865 RADIUS Servers.

Features:
* Supports popular RADIUS Servers including OpenRADIUS, FreeRADIUS and
  commercial servers.
* Distributed Authentication Cache using apr_memcache.
* Local Authentication Cache using DBM.
* Uses standard HTTP Basic Authentication, unlike mod_auth_radius which uses
  cookies for sessions.
