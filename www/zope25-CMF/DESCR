The Zope Content Management Framework provides a set of
services and content objects useful for building highly
dynamic, content-oriented portal sites.  As packaged, the
CMF generates a site much like the Zope.org site.  The CMF is
intended to be easily customizable, in terms of both the
types of content used and the policies and services it
provides.
