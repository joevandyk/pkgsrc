This module allows user authentication (and can log authenthication
requests) against information stored in a PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL is a public domain SQL database.

Authentication

One database, and one (or two) tables.  One table holds the username
and the encryped (or plain) password. The other table holds the
username and the names of the group to which the user belongs.  It
is possible to have username, groupname and password in the same
table.

Access Logging

Every authentication access is logged in the same database of the
authentication table, but in different table. User name and date
of the request are logged. As option, it can log password, ip
address, request line.
