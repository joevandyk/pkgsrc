The MetaPublisher is a very flexible tool. It can be used to implement a
guestbook, an address book or a system for news articles with an archive. With
the help of two MetaPublishers, you can create a Squishdot like site. It can
even be used for a web directory such as Yahoo.

The MetaPublisher product allows to store miscellaneous data in a table. Each
row represents one entry. Each entry stores information in a format, predefined
by a configuration. The columns each represent a field in the configuration.

An easy way to create appropriate forms to maintain the data is also provided.
The configuration and the predefined forms can be stored in a preset. These
presets can be used to create new MetaPublishers of the same type at later
time.
