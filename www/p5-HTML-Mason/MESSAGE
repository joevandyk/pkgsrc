In order to use HTML::Mason with mod_perl and Apache you have to create
the "data directory" (aka data_dir), which is used by Mason for various
features and optimizations, and change your web server configuration
accordingly.
The data directory must be writable by the user account specified for the
Apache process in your httpd.conf file.

As an example, if you use "/var/mason" as your data directory you have
to add the following line to httpd.conf:

  PerlSetVar  MasonDataDir   /var/mason

For more details, have a look at the "Mason Administrator's Manual" at
