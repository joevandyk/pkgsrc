Features of this improved cvsweb:
- You can browse the file hierarchy by picking directories (e.g., src/).
- If you pick a file, you will see the revision history for that file.
- Selecting a revision number will download that revision of the file.
- There is a link at each revision to display (colored) diffs between
  that revision and the previous one or to annotate a revision.
- A form at the bottom of the page that allows you to display diffs
  between arbitrary revisions.
