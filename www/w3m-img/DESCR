W3m is a terminal-based WWW browser which supports HTML tables and frames.
It's small, so faster than other WWW browsers.  It also supports following
URL by clicking mouse button on the anchor in xterm and its variants from
990526 version.  Additionally, this package enables inline-image support
which is added in version 0.3.

It uses Boehm-GC to implement the table/frame parser.

                                          patch/README.m17n
  It is a development version. And enough test is not preformed because
  I can understand Japanese only. Please use, test, and report bugs.
