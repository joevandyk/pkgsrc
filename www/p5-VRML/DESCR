  A set of VRML classes for Perl5.  Documentation for these modules is
part of the files themselves using the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format,
and can be read using the pod2man and pod2html programs that come with
perl5.001.  To convert them into manual page format, type something like
the following:

        pod2man VRML.pm > VRML.1

To convert them into html format, type:

        pod2html VRML.pm > VRML.html

Online documentation of these modules as well as related modules (such
as the earlier VRML.pm module)  can be found at:

Many examples of VRML scripts of various degrees of complexity can be
