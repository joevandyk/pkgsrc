Sitecopy is for copying locally stored web sites to remote web servers.  A
single command will upload files to the server which have changed locally,
and delete files from the server which have been removed locally, to keep
the remote site synchronized with the local site.  The aim is to remove the
hassle of uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.
Sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move locally, and move
them remotely.

FTP, WebDAV and other HTTP-based authoring servers (for instance, AOLserver
and Netscape Enterprise) are supported.
