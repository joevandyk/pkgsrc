The goal of CGI::FormBuilder is to provide an easy way to generate and
process CGI form-based applications. It is designed to be smart in that
it figures a lot of stuff out for you. As a result, FormBuilder gives
about a 4:1 ratio of the code it generates versus what you have to write.

For example, if you have multiple values for a field, it sticks them
in a radio, checkbox, or select group, depending on some factors. It
will also automatically name fields for you in human-readable labels
depending on the field names, and lay everything out in a nicely
formatted table. It will even title the form based on the name of the
script itself (order_form.cgi becomes "Order Form").

Plus, FormBuilder provides you full-blown validation for your fields,
including some useful builtin patterns. It will even generate
JavaScript validation routines on the fly! And, of course, it
maintains state ("stickiness") across submissions, with hooks provided
for you to plugin your own sessionid module such as Apache::Session.

And though it's smart, it allows you to customize it as well. For
example, if you really want something to be a checkbox, you can make
it a checkbox. And, if you really want something to be output a
specific way, you can even specify the name of an HTML::Template or
Template Toolkit (Template) compatible template which will be
automatically filled in, statefully.
