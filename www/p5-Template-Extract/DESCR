This module is a subclass of the Template toolkit, with added
template extraction functionality.  It can take a rendered document
and its template together, and get the original data structure
back, effectively reversing the "process" function.

This module is considered experimental.  If you just wish to extract
RSS-type information out of a HTML document, WWW::SherlockSearch
may be a more robust solution.
