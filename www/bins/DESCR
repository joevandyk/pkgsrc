The aim of BINS is to generate static HTML photo albums. Some of the
functionalities of BINS are:
* album can contains other albums (sub albums): tree structure
* generation of a thumbnail and of scaled images for each picture
* generated album appearance is fully customizable by using HTML
  templates and configuration parameters
* several description fields (date, location, etc...) can be
  associated with the pictures (in text or HTML format)
* Exif information and Digital camera support:
  o use the EXIF data structure found on some image files (usually,
    those produced by digital cameras) to fill automatically some fields
    (date and time for example).
  o BINS use the Orientation EXIF tag (which is normally set when you
    rotate a image on you DigiCam) to rotate the picture to correct
    orientation.
  o For each image, a page provides all information available on the
    picture and the DigiCam settings when the photo was taken.
  o All EXIF information is saved in the XML description file,
    preventing they disappear when the image is modified
* customizable charset encoding for HTML generation, including UTF-8
  (Unicode) support by default. Generation of the Apache .htaccess file
  for correct encoding charset in HTTP headers
* generate valid HTML 4 code.
