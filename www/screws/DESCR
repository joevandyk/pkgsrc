Screws is an experimental web server with extensibility in mind. It's
designed in a little core that processes connections and petitions, setenv
the spected values and calls an external program or script that processes
this and shows what it wants. By this way it's possible to customize
every answer of the web server, and extend it as we want in a simple way.

Some features are:
 - UID/GID/CHROOT directives
 - Dynamic Module loading (security, optimization, extensions, etc..)
 - HSML (Embed scripts into HTML) Like PHP but using your prefered language.
 - Support for perl, sh, python, lua, brainfuck, Java...
 - Portable code: tested on Solaris, *BSD, GNU/Hurd, Darwin...
 - IPv4/IPv6 support
