In order to enable mod_chroot in your Apache installation, you need to add
the following to your httpd.conf file:

	LoadModule chroot_module lib/httpd/mod_chroot.so

Please also refer to the documentation in:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_chroot/

It can be useful to null mount /var/run into CHROOTDIR/var/run, so that
apachectl and etc/rc.d/apache can still find the PID to stop apache.

For the UserDir feature, CHROOTDIR/etc/pwd.db and passwd need to exist.
Alternatively, instead of UserDir, one could null mount
/home/USER/public_html into DocumentRoot/~USER.

Take care configuring DocumentRoot, because apache will not start unless
the directory also exists before the chroot is performed.
