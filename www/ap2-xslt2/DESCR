mod-xslt2 is a server side module able to transform ``xml''
documents in ``html'' (or to any other format) before they
even get back to the browser.

mod-xslt2 main features include:

* Ability to parse generated xml (ability to parse the output of
  php or perl scripts).

* Ability to use the ``xslt'' indicated by the <?xml-stylesheet
  processing instruction.

* Ability to send back the xml file unparsed to the browser.

* Ability to fetch xslt or DTDs from scripts rather than from
  static files.

* Ability to fetch a different xslt depending on the content of
  the request headers, of the get parameters or the web server
  environment.

* Ability to allow xslt stylesheets to make use of these
  variables to generate output.
