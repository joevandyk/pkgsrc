The Count program is a standard CGI program to count raw access hits in web
pages. This is a graphic counter, that means it only counts if the browser
support graphics.  It keeps the hits in text files. The program tries to
maintain data integrity by locking the datafile. Among its many features,
it also can be used to show time, date (of any timezone in the world),
and countdown to a date. This single program can be used for any number
of web pages, for any number of users.
