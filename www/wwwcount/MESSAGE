If you are using this program, I like to hear from you.  If you are
having any problem with the program, please let me know as well.
Feel free to send any suggestion.  If you think that the program is
cool, please consider sending me a picture postcard of the area
where you live.  Thanks to all of you who sent me the nice
postcards.  I really appreciate it.
