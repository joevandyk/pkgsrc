This module provides a Active Server Pages port to Apache. Active Server
Pages is a web application platform that originated with Microsoft's IIS
server. Under Apache for both Win32 and Unix, it allows a developer to
create web applications with session management and perl embedded in
static html files.

This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveWare's PerlScript and MKS's
PScript implementation of perl for IIS ASP. Work has been done and will
continue to make ports to and from these other implementations as seamless
as possible.
