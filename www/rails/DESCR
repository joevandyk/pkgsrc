Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web
applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.  From the
Ajax in the view, to the request and response in the controller, to
the domain model wrapping the database, Rails gives you a pure-Ruby
development environment.  To go live, all you need to add is a
database and a web server.
