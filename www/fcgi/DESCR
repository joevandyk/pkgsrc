FastCGI is an open extension to CGI that provides high performance for
all Internet applications without the penalties of Web server APIs.

FastCGI is designed to be layered on top of existing Web server APIs.
For instance, the mod_fastcgi Apache module adds FastCGI support to
the Apache server.  FastCGI can also be used, with reduced
functionality and reduced performance, on any Web server that supports
CGI.

This FastCGI Developer's Kit is designed to make developing FastCGI
applications easy.  The kit currently supports FastCGI applications
written in C/C++, Perl, Tcl, and Java.
