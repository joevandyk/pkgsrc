Kwiki::PagePrivacy is a plugin that lets you mark individual pages as:

    * Public - normal readable/writable
    * Protected - readonly to everyone except the control group.
    * Private - invisible to everyone but the control group.

Each "view" or a point of entry into the kwiki has an associated
control (permissions) group.

Here is the typical setup process:

	kwiki -new mykwiki
	cd mykwiki
	kwiki -add Kwiki::PagePrivacy
	kwiki -new_view admin
	echo 'privacy_group: admin' > admin/config2.yaml

Don't forget to secure the admin view with something like Apache's
.htaccess files.  You only want people who are admins setting the
privacy levels.
