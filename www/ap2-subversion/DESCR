The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that
is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community. The software
is released under an Apache/BSD-style open source license.

This package contains the mod_dav_svn Apache2 module, which implements
a sub-set of WebDAV DeltaV; it is the server back-end for Subversion's
'ra_dav' repository access mechanism.  The server for the 'ra_svn'
access mechanism is included in the subversion package.

One of the long-term goals of mod_dav_svn is to provide a complete
implementation of WebDAV and DeltaV, so that other WebDAV clients
(such as Microsoft Office) can use a Subversion repository.
