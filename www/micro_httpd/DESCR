micro_httpd is a very small HTTP server. It runs from inetd, which means
its performance is poor.  But for low-traffic sites, it's quite adequate.
It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:

  *  Security against ".." filename snooping.
  *  The common MIME types.
  *  Trailing-slash redirection.
  *  index.html.
  *  Directory listings.

All in about 200 lines of code.
