An Apache module designed to provide Kerberos authentication to the
Apache web server. Using the Basic Auth mechanism, it retrieves a
username/password pair from the browser and checks them against a
Kerberos server as set up by your particular organization. The module
also supports the Negotiate authentication method, which performs full
Kerberos authentication based on ticket exchanges, and does not require
users to insert their passwords to the browser.
