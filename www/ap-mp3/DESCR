mod_mp3 turns the Apache Web server into an MP3 or Ogg streaming
server. It can play from a list of files, either in order or randomly.
It can also be used to cache MP3s into memory and have the server
operate entirely from memory. It has an XML-RPC interface for you to
write interfaces around and supports retrieving information via
XML/RSS.
