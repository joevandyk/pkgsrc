The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end
for Web server(s).  Pound was developed to enable distributing the
load among several Web-servers and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper
for those Web servers that do not offer it natively.  Pound is a very
small program, easily audited for security problems.  It can run as
setuid/setgid and/or in a chroot jail.  Pound does not access the
hard-disk at all (except for reading the certificate file on start,
if required) and should thus pose no security threat to any machine.
