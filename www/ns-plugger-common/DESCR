  Tired of getting teased by Windows users because your Netscape isn't as
|<()()|_ as theirs?  Well, your problems are almost solved.  Plugger is a
multimedia plugin for Unix Netscape 3.0 or later that handles Quicktime, MPEG,
MP2, AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim, MIDI, Soundtracker, AU, WAV and
Commodore 64 audio files.  And now, with Plugger 3.2, MPEG audio and video can
be played streaming.

  No more waiting!  Plugger is a very small plugin, because plugger uses
external programs to show/play the different formats.
