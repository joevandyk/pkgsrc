HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation
for perl.  It is not intended as a replacement for the fully-features
LWP module.  Instead, it is intended for use in situations where
it is desirable to install the minimal number of modules to achieve
HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good candidate due to CPU
overhead, such as slower processors.  HTTP::Lite is also significantly
faster than LWP.
