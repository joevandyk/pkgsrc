Kwiki-Wikiwyg is a Kwiki plugin that adds WYSIWYG editing capabilities
to a Kwiki.  The underlying technology is Wikiwyg, a Javascript library
that can be easily integrated into any wiki or blog software.  It
offers the user multiple ways to edit/view a piece of content:

    * Wysiwyg mode - Simple, HTML, Design Mode editing.
    * Wikitext mode - Standard, Wiki, Text Area editing.
    * Preview mode - Display mode without saving changes.

Wikiwyg allows you to switch between modes, delegating some of the
processing to the server when necessary.
