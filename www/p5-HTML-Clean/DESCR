The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of common techniques for
minimizing the size of HTML files.  You can typically save between 10% and
50% of the size of a HTML file using these methods.  It provides the
following features:

	Remove unneeded whitespace (beginning of line, etc.)
	Remove unneeded META elements
	Remove HTML comments (except for styles, javascript and SSI)
	Replace tags with equivilant shorter tags (<strong> --> <b>, etc.)
