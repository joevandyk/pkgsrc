A Wiki is a website that allows its users to add pages, and edit any
existing pages.

You can create a new kwiki website with a single command. The module
has no prerequisite modules, except the ones that ship with Perl.
It doesn't require a database backend, although it could be made to
use one. The default kwiki behaviour is fairly full featured, and includes
support for html tables. Any behaviour of the kwiki can be customized,
without much trouble.
