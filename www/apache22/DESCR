The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for various modern desktop and server operating
systems, such as UNIX and Windows NT.  The goal of this project is to
provide a secure, efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP
services in sync with the current HTTP standards.
