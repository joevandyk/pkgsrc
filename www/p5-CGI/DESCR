This perl library uses perl5 objects to make it easy to create Web
fill-out forms and parse their contents.  This package defines CGI
objects, entities that contain the values of the current query string
and other state variables.  Using a CGI object's methods, you can
examine keywords and parameters passed to your script, and create
forms whose initial values are taken from the current query (thereby
preserving state information).  The module provides shortcut functions
that produce boilerplate HTML, reducing typing and coding errors. It
also provides functionality for some of the more advanced features of
CGI scripting, including support for file uploads, cookies, cascading
style sheets, server push, and frames.

CGI.pm also provides a simple function-oriented programming style for
those who don't need its object-oriented features.
