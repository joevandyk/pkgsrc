August is a very simple, free HTML editor for the UNIX platform.
It is a non-WYSIWYG editor like Aswedit or Hotdog. It has buttons
to insert standard HTML tags and other common simple text editor
commands.

August is written with the Tcl/TK scripting language and graphical
toolkit.  It's distributed as a single script, which means that if
you know Tcl/Tk you can very easily customize August yourself.
