The Perl module LWPx::ParanoidAgent is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent,
but paranoid against attackers. It's to be used when you're fetching a
remote resource on behalf of a possibly malicious user.

This class can do whatever LWP::UserAgent can (callbacks, uploads from
files, etc), except proxy support is explicitly removed, because in that
case you should do your paranoia at your proxy. Only "http:" and "https:"
URL schemes are supported.
