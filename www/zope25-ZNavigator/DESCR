The ZNavigator product was designed to simplify the construction
of navigation bars. It was written to make navbar management
easy for inexperienced contents managers, and provide some nifty features.
Many of the features and their usage are demonstrated in the navigator_demo
package, in the demo/ directory (see the INSTALL document for information
on how to intall the demos). The ZNavigator and NavItem also have online help
tabs.
