drraw is a simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool that
allows you to interactively build graphs of your own design. A
graph definition can be turned into a template which may be applied
to many Round Robin Database files. drraw specializes in providing
an easy mean of displaying data stored with RRDtool and does not
care about how the data is collected, making it a great complement
to other RRDtool front-ends.
