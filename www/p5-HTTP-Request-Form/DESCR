This is an extension of the HTTP::Request suite. It allows easy
processing of forms in a user agent by filling out fields,
querying fields, selections and buttons and pressing buttons. It
uses HTML::TreeBuilder generated parse trees of documents
(especially the forms parts extracted with extract_links) and
generates its own internal representation of forms from which
it then generates the request objects to process the form
application.
