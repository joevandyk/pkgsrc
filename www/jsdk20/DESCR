JSDK 2.0 is an older version of Sun's Java Servlet Development Kit.
It includes the servlet java classes and a simple web server with
servlet support.

JSDK has been supplanted by project Jakarta, which is a joint project
between The Apache Foundation and Sun to produce the next generation
of the servlet classes.  The 3.0 release of the Jakarta project's
servlet environment, Tomcat, is available via the www/jakarta-tomcat
package.

This package exists primarily to support building the Apache JServ
module, which has not yet been updated to build against the Tomcat
classes.
