  Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML
documents.  Using Perl means being able to use a very
elaborate programming language, which is widely used for
WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl modules
which have already been written - including DBI - for
database access to a growing number of database systems.

  While this could also be done with other packages, Embperl
has several features especially for HTML: dynamic tables,
formfield-processing, escaping/unescaping and more.

  Embperl is a server-side tool, which means it's
browser-independent.  It can run in various ways: Under
mod_perl, as a cgi script, or offline.

  There is also a module for Database access within Embperl,
look at DBIx::Recordset.
