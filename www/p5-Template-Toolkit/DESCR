The Template Toolkit is a perl5 module which implements a fast, flexible,
powerful and extensible template processing system.  It was originally
designed and remains primarily useful for generating dynamic web content,
but can be used equally well for processing other kinds of text based
documents: HTML, XML, POD, PostScript, LaTex, etc.
