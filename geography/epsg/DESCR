EPSG Geodetic Parameters

The Surveying and Positioning Committee of the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP), through its Geodesy
Subcommittee, maintains and publishes a dataset of parameters for
coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation description.
The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset has been included as reference
data in UKOOA and SEG positioning data exchange formats, the GeoTIFF
interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery, the IHS Energy
Iris21, PPDM and POSC Epicentre data models.  The dataset is
distributed in an MS Access relational database and SQL script files.

This package includes the PostgreSQL and mySQL scripts for creating
the EPSG database.
