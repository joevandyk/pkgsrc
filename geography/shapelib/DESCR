The Shapefile C Library provides the ability to write simple C programs
for reading, writing and updating (to a limited extent) ESRI
Shapefiles, and the associated attribute file (.dbf). The Shapefile
format is a working and interchange format promulgated by ESRI for
simple vector data with attributes.
