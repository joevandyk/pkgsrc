Xrmap is an GPL'd user-friendly X program which can be used to generate
accurate images of small or bigger portions of the Earth. The main data
source is the CIA World Data Bank II.
The CIA_WDB2 consists of vector descriptions of coastlines and islands,
political boundaries, major and minor rivers, glaciers, lakes, canals,
reefs, etc. The accuracy of the data is at best 1" of arc, approximately
30 meters at the Equator -- in fact all recorded points are given by
integer coordinates representing seconds of arc.
