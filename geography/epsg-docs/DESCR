EPSG Geodetic Parameters

The OGP Surveying and Positioning Committee, through its geodesy
sub-committee, maintains and publishes a dataset of parameters for
coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation description.
The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset has been included as reference
data in UKOOA and SEG positioning data exchange formats, the GeoTIFF
interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery, the IHS Energy
Iris21, PPDM and POSC Epicentre data models.  The dataset is
distributed in an MS Access relational database and SQL script files.

This package includes the technical documentation for the EPSG database.
