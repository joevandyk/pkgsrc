Vis5D is a system for interactive visualization of large 5-D gridded data sets
such as those produced by numerical weather models. One can make isosurfaces,
contour line slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc of data in a 3-D
grid, then rotate and animate the images in real time. There is also a feature
for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text anotations for publications,
support for interactive data analysis, etc. GRASS can import and export Vis5D
raster data.
