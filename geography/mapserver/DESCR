MapServer is an OpenSource development environment for building spatially
enabled Internet applications.  It now supports MapScript which allows popular
scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Tk/Tcl, Guile and even Java to
access the MapServer C API.  MapScript provides a rich environment for
developing applications that integrate disparate data.
