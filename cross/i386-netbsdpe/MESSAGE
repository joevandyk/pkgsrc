This pkg DOES NOT install headers or runtime link libraries.  Only the
compilers are installed.

In order to have a complete development setup, you need to install
includes and libraries in ${CROSSBASE}/i386-netbsdpe/include and
${CROSSBASE}/i386-netbsdpe/lib respectively, or symlink these paths to
the appropriate places.
