This cross-compile environment is for MS-DOS on the 386 and higher
processors, with some kind of DPMI 0.9 or later layer.  The produced
binaries will run on MS-DOS with a DPMI driver (one of which can be
obtained from the DJGPP distribution site), Windows 3.1 with Win32s,
Windows 95, and Windows NT.

Additional includes and libraries put into $CROSSBASE/i386-msdosdjgpp/ can
provide other services.  Available are pdcurses, winsock drivers
(<sys/socket.h> based on Winsock), and more.  Look at the DJGPP web-site,
http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/, for more information.
