AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader/UploaDEr - is a program for updating the
flash, eeprom, and fuse bit memories of Atmel AVR microcontrollers.
Avrdude supports a wide variety of chip programmers (including the
widely used STK500) that attach to the serial port, and, if supported
by the underlying OS, to the parallel port.
