Taken from the dbench README file:

	Netbench is a terrible benchmark, but it's an "industry
	standard" and it's what is used in the press to rate windows
	fileservers like Samba and WindowsNT.

	In order for the development methodologies of the open source
	community to work we need to be able to run this benchmark in
	an environment that a bunch of us have access to.  We need the
	source to the benchmark so we can see what it does.  We need
	to be able to split it into pieces to look for individual
	bottlenecks.  In short, we need to open up netbench to the
	masses.

	To do this I have written three tools, dbench, tbench and
	smbtorture.  All three read a load description file called
	client.txt that was derived from a network sniffer dump of a
	real netbench run.  client.txt is about 4MB and describes the
	90 thousand operations that a netbench client does in a
	typical netbench run.  They parse client.txt and use it to
	produce the same load without having to buy a huge lab.  They
	can simulate any number of simultaneous clients.
