This Sieve of Eratosthenes program works with variable size arrays. It is
a straight forward extension of the original Gilbreath version (
Gilbreath, Jim. "A High-Level Language Benchmark." BYTE, September 1981,
p. 180, and also Gilbreath, Jim and Gary. "Eratosthenes Revisited: Once
More Through the Sieve." BYTE January 1983, p. 283 ). Unlike the Sieve of
Gilbreath, NSIEVE uses register long variables, pointers,and large byte
arrays via 'malloc()'.  Maximum array size is currently set at 2.56 MBytes
but this can be increased or decreased by changing the program LIMIT
constant.
