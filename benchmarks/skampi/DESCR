The SKaMPI-Benchmark is a suite of tests designed to measure the performance
of MPI. MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a machine independent standard to
provide an efficient interface to message passing libraries of different
parallel machines. The goal of SKaMPI is to create a database to illustrate
the performance of these different MPI implementations. This database should
allow to:
1. Decide how to implement portable and efficient MPI programs.
2. Predict the performance of MPI programs.
3. Describe supercomputers in terms of MPI.
