Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at performing a number
of simple tests of hard drive and file system performance. Then
you can decide which test is important and decide how to compare
different systems after running it. There are no plans to ever have
it produce a single number, because the author thinks that a single
number can be useful when comparing such things. The main program
tests database type access to a single file (or a set of files if
you wish to test more than 1G of storage), and it tests creation,
reading, and deleting of small files which can simulate the usage
of programs such as Squid, INN, or Maildir format email. The ZCAV
program which the author initially released as a separate package
tests the performance of different zones of a hard drive. It does
not write any data (so you can use it on full file systems). It
can show why comparing the speed of Windows at the start of a hard
drive to Linux at the end of the hard drive (typical dual-boot
scenario) isn't a valid comparison. Bonnie++ was based on the code
for Bonnie by Tim Bray.
