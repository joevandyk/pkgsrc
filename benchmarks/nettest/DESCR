The nettest and nettestd commands perform client and server
performance tests for various types of interprocess communication.
These tests time the data throughput of pipes and UNIX domain, TCP,
and UDP socket connections.

The nettest command performs the client side of the test; the
nettestd command performs the server side of the test.
