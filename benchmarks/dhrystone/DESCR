Here is Reinhold Weicker's DHRYSTONE 2.1 benchmark, slightly modified
by me for instrumentation purposes only.  This is an integer CPU
benchmark.  The differences between 2.0 and 2.1 are minor, and
I believe that 2.0 and 2.1 results are comparable.

Best results will be achieved by running the benchmark with more than
1 million iterations.
