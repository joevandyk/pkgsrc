HBench-OS is a suite of portable benchmarks designed to measure the
performance of primitive functionality provided by an operating
system/hardware platform. HBench-OS was designed primarily as a
research tool for the systems research and OS development communities,
and thus its major design goal is to provide a flexible system for
reproducible, accurate, and statistically-sound performance analysis
and evaluation. These characteristics make it ideal for both
performance research as well as more traditional consumer-oriented
performance measurement and analysis.
