Ttcp (test TCP) times the transmission and reception of data  between two
systems  using  the UDP or TCP protocols.  It differs from common ``blast''
tests, which  tend  to  measure  the remote inetd as much as the network
performance, and which usually do not allow measurements at the remote end
of a UDP transmission.
