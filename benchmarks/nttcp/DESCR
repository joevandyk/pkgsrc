NTTCP (New TTCP) times the transmission and reception of data  between two
systems  using  the UDP or TCP protocols.  It differs from common ``blast''
tests, which  tend  to  measure  the remote inetd as much as the network
performance, and which usually do not allow measurements at the remote end
of a UDP transmission.

The following is a short list of the improvements which have been made
over "classic" TTCP:

	* Ported to a variety of operating systems
	* Can be started via inetd
	* Output can be customized on the commnad line
	* Centralized reporting of the measurements
	* Traffic checksumming to detect failures in UDP transmissions
	* Multicast support
