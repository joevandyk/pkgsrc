Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001),
TDC2003 (2003).

Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):

Range           Description
U+0020-U+007F   Basic Latin
U+00A0-U+00FF   Latin-1 Supplement
U+0100-U+017F   Latin Extended-A
U+0180-U+021F   Latin Extended-B
U+0222-U+0233   Latin Extended-B (continued)
U+0250-U+02AD   IPA Extensions
U+02B0-U+02FF   Spacing Modifier Letters
U+0300-U+036F   Combining Diacritical Marks
U+0370-U+03D5   Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
U+1E00-U+1EFF   Latin Extended Additional
U+1F00-U+1FFF   Greek Extended

U+20A0-U+20CF   Currency Symbols (partial)
U+2100-U+214F   Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)

Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
4.1.
