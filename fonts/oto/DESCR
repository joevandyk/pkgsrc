The Open Type Organizer project provides programs to list and modify
the 'name' and 'cmap' tables of OpenType font files. It can be used to
translate the 'name' and 'cmap' of an OpenType font in locale encodings
to Unicode encodings, so the font file can be used in an environment
which does not understand locale encodings. The translated tables are
added to the font while keeping the original tables intact.

Have a True Type font which is not recognized by X Window system?
Chances are, the font is listed/indexed in an encoding other than
Unicode!  Open Type Organizer (oTo) will help to solve the problem.
It will list font file organization and even add Unicode 'name' and
'cmap' tables by translating the original ones.  Your favorite ttf
font can really work for you now.
