The bdftopcf tool converts X fonts from Bitmap Distribution Format
to Portable Compiled Format.

Fonts in the Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture,
although  the file  is  structured  to allow one particular
architecture to read them directly without reformatting.  This
allows fast reading on the  appropriate machine, but the files
are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines.
