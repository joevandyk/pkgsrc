The freefont project provides a set of free, high-quality, outline
(i.e. OpenType) fonts covering the ISO 10646/Unicode UCS (Universal
Character Set).  This set consists of three TrueType typefaces:
one monospaced and two proportional -- one with uniform and one
with modulated stroke. These fonts are similar to the Helvetica,
Times and Courier fonts.
