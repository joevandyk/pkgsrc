Unicode fonts
=============

The new libXg distribution supports Unicode.  Sam and 9term built using
the new UTF libXg will allow one to enter and edit files containing
Unicode characters encoded using UTF-2 (UTF-FSS).
To use them:

o	convert the bdf files to whatever format is appropriate for
	your system and place the files in a suitable common directory
o	set this directory up as an X font directory by running some
	program such as `mkfontdir' if necessary
o	add the directory to your fontpath `xset fp+ fontdir'
o	make sure libXg knows about the fontfile you wish to use by
	setting the appropriate .p9font X resource (or just *p9font) to
	be something like /lib/font/Xg/matty/unicode.9.font or by
	specifying an appropriate -p9font argument to libXg programs.
