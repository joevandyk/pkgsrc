This package installs two free TrueType fonts, they are useful for web viewing.

The typeface is Geometric Slabserif 703, which is Bitstream's version of
Memphis  a typeface designed in 1930 by Rudolph Weiss. While it may seem odd
that a typeface designed 65 years ago would look good on-screen today,
the reason has to do with the shape of the letterforms themselves.

They have a simple, geometric shape, and their serifs (the small protrusions
from the ends of the letter) are in the "slab" family, which means they, too,
are simple. The "x-height" (the height of the lowercase letter "x") is
relatively large, but not so large that it makes reading difficult in the web
where there is little real control over leading (the space between the lines).

Bitstream is supplying these typefaces to help you see the importance of type
on the web. Once you see how different web pages can look just by changing the
typeface, and how much easier they can be to read, you'll see the importance of
typographic choice on the web.
