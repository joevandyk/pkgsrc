Once the files are in place, they need to be added to the font database.
This can be accomplished with one of the following commands:

	xset fp+ ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/Mozilla

Note that the above will only make the fonts available for the duration of
your current X session. If they are to be installed and usable
permanently, either the aforementioned command should be placed in one of
your X startup files (usually something like ~/.Xclients or ~/.Xsession),
or the directory location should be added to the system's font server
configuration.

About configuring Netscape to use the new fonts, see
${PREFIX}/share/doc/mozilla-fonts/README.
