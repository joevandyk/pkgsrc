t1lib is a library written in C which implements functions for generating
bitmaps from Adobe Type 1 fonts. It uses most internal parts of the Type 1
rasterizer provided with X11R5 and newer but tries avoid the disadvantages
known from that rasterizer. Although most people would use the rasterizer
under X11, having X11 is not necessary at all.

The rasterizer is implemented as a shared or static library to be linked
to the programs that want to use Type 1 fonts. In addition to this library
there is a test-program called xglyph which, as the name indicates,
requires X11. It can be used to show most of the features of the library.
xglyph can be run out of the box without doing any X11 configuration like
setting resources.
