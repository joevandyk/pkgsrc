type1inst is a small perl script which generates the "fonts.scale"
file required by an X11 server to use any Type 1 PostScript fonts
which exist in a particular directory.  It gathers this informatiom
from the font files themselves, a task which previously was done
by hand.  The script is also capable of generating the similar
"Fontmap" file used by ghostscript.  It can also generate sample
sheets for the fonts.
