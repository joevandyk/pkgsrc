LibTomMath provides highly optimized and portable routines for a
vast majority of integer based number theoretic applications
(including public key cryptography). LibTomMath is not a cryptographic
toolkit itself but it can be used to write one [Used in LibTomCrypt
for RSA, DH and ECC public key routines].
