METIS is a family of programs for partitioning unstructured graphs and
hypergraphs and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices.
The underlying algorithms used by METIS are based on the
state-of-the-art multilevel paradigm that has been shown to produce
high quality results and scale to very large problems.  It is
available both as a set of stand-alone programs and as a library.
