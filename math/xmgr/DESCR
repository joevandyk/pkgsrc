xmgr is an XY plotting tool for scientific data using X. A few of
its features are:

    * User defined scaling, tick marks, labels, symbols, line styles, colors.
    * Batch mode for unattended plotting.
    * Read and write parameters used during a session.
    * Polynomial regression, splines, running averages, DFT/FFT,
	cross/auto-correlation.
    * Hardcopy support for PostScript, HP-GL, and FrameMaker .mif format.

While xmgr has a convenient point-and-click interface, most parameter settings
and operations are available through a command line interface (found in
Data/Commands).
