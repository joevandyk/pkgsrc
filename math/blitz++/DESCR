Blitz++ is a C++ class library for scientific computing which provides
performance on par with Fortran 77/90. It uses template techniques to
achieve high performance. The current versions provide dense arrays
and vectors, random number generators, and small vectors and matrices.
Blitz++ is distributed freely under an open source license, and
contributions to the library are welcomed.
