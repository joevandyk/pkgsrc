Gnumeric is a powerful and easy to use spreadsheet program from
the GNOME project.  The goal for this spreadsheet is to compete
with the commercial offerings.  Users of Excel should be already
familiar with Gnumeric advanced features.  A plugin system lets
you extend Gnumeric with GPL extensions, and an optional
Python and Perl plugins let you define complex functions in those
popular languages.
