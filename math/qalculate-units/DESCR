Qalculate! Units is a new utility for conversion between units using the
Qalculate! library. A large number of units can be selected from a list or be
entered directly, allowing any combination of different units and prefixes.
Qalculate! Units supports full mathematical expressions, with a large number
of functions, constants and fault-tolerant parsing.
