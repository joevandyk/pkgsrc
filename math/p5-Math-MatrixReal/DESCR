Math::MatrixReal - Matrix of Reals

This module includes many important matrix operations and methods:
matrix norm, matrix transposition, matrix inverse, determinant of a
matrix, order and numerical condition of a matrix, scalar product of
vectors, vector product of vectors, vector length, projection of row
and column vectors, a comfortable way for reading in a matrix from a
file, the keyboard or your code, and many more.

Systems of linear equations may be solved using an efficient algorithm
known as "L-R-decomposition" and several approximative (iterative)
methods. The Householder transformation and QL decomposition for the
determination of the eigensystem of a real symmetric matrix are also
implemented.

The module also features an implementation of Kleene's algorithm to
compute the minimal costs for all paths in a graph with weighted edges
(the "weights" being the costs associated with each edge).
