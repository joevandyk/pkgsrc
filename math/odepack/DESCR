ODEPACK is a collection of Fortran solvers for the initial value
problem for ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems.  It
currently includes six solvers, suitable for both stiff and nonstiff
systems, and includes solvers for systems given in linearly implicit
form as well as solvers for systems given in explicit form.
