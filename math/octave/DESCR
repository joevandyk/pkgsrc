GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
with Matlab.  It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating
ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary
differential and differential-algebraic equations.  It is easily extensible
and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own
language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran,
or other languages.

GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software.  You may redistribute
it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation.

Octave was written by John W. Eaton and many others.  Because Octave is
free software you are encouraged to help make Octave more useful by writing
and contributing additional functions for it, and by reporting any problems
you may have.
