Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.  Numarray provides support for manipulating arrays
consisting of numbers, strings, records, or objects using the same
basic infrastructure and syntax.
