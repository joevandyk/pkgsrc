This is a port of the GNU Scientific Library to the Ruby programming language.

Things from GSL you can use in ruby-gsl:
- some error handling (ch. 3 in the GSL documentation)
- basic mathematical functions (ch. 4)
- complex numbers (ch. 5)
- functions for polynomial evaluation/roots (ch. 6)
- most "special functions" (ch. 7)
- vectors and matrices (ch. 8)
- permutations (ch. 9)
- combinations (ch. 10)
- BLAS support (ch. 12)
- linear algebra (ch. 13)
- eigensystems (ch. 14)
- numerical integration (ch. 16)
- random number generation (ch. 17)
- quasi-random sequences (ch. 18)
- most random number distributions (ch. 19)
- most statistical functions (ch. 20)
- histograms (ch. 21)
- Monte Carlo integration (ch. 23)
- Simulated Annealing (not reliable) (ch. 24)
- interpolation (ch. 26)
- numerical differentiation (ch. 27)
