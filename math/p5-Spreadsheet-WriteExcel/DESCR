The Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module can be used to create a cross-
platform Excel binary file. Multiple worksheets can be added to a
workbook and formatting can be applied to cells. Text, numbers,
formulas, hyperlinks and images can be written to the cells.

The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5,
95, 97, 2000 and 2002.

The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
Macintosh platforms. Generated files are also compatible with the
Linux/UNIX spreadsheet applications Gnumeric and OpenOffice.
The generated files are not compatible with MS Access.
