Geg is capable of drawing 2-dimensional mathematical functions
within a nice user interface. e.g., f(x) = 3 + sin(x/2). geg
allows you to view multiple functions simultaneously, with each
function drawn in a different color. Functions can be selectively
erased and are easily identifiable by colour matching. The
viewport can be zoomed in and out, and can xoom in on selected
regions. geg is easy to use, good looking, compact and customisable.
