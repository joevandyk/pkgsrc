GAP (Groups, Algorithms and Programs) is a free system for computational
discrete algebra. Its capabilities include computation involving
cyclotomic and finite fields, residue class rings, p-adic numbers,
multivariate polynomials and rational functions, vectors, matrices
and finite groups.

GAP can be copied and distributed freely for any non-commercial purpose.

If you use GAP in your research papers, please inform gap@dcs.st-and.ac.uk
and cite GAP in your publication. Please see
