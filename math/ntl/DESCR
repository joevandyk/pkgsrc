NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data
structures and algorithms for arbitrary length integers; for vectors,
matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over finite fields;
and for arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic.

NTL provides high quality implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms for:

   o arbitrary length integer arithmetic and arbitrary precision
     floating point arithmetic;
   o polynomial arithmetic over the integers and finite fields
     including basic arithmetic, polynomial factorization,
     irreducibility testing, computation of minimal polynomials,
     traces, norms, and more;
   o lattice basis reduction, including very robust and fast
     implementations of Schnorr-Euchner, block Korkin-Zolotarev
     reduction, and the new Schnorr-Horner pruning heuristic for block
     Korkin-Zolotarev;
   o basic linear algebra over the integers, finite fields, and
     arbitrary precision floating point numbers.

NTL is free software, and may be used according to the terms of the
