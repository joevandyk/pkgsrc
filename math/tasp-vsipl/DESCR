This is an implementation of a VSIP Library (Vector/Signal/Image
Processing Library) as defined by the VSIPL Forum for a CORE profile.

The TASP_VSIPL library is an effort to produce a VSIPL library
suitable for demonstration and early development and testing of VSIPL
code and ideas.

The Tactical Advanced Signal Processing Common Operating Environment
(TASP COE) effort is striving to produce a common operating
environment for signal processing throughout the Navy and DOD for the
COTS environment. VSIPL is thought by TASP to have a good chance of
becoming a standard signal processing library for many vendors who
supply DOD high performance computing products.  For this reason TASP
is supporting the VSIPL effort.

This is the TASP VSIPL Core Plus implementation of VSIPL. Core Plus
includes all the functionality of the core profile plus most floating
point Vector and Elementwise Operations not required by the VSIPL Core
profile.  The additional functions include such things as matrix
elementwise add and multiply.

The TASP VSIPL code is required to be freely available for any
use.
