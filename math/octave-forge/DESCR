The octave-forge project contains functions for Octave which are not in
the main distribution.  While the main Octave distribution is
conservative about accepting new functions and changes, octave-forge is
very open.  As a result, be prepared for some lower quality code and
more rapidly changing interfaces to the functions in octave-forge.
