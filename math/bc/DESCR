Bc is an arbitrary precision calculator language.  Syntax is similar
to C, but differs in many substantial areas.  It supports interactive
execution of statements

It can also be used as a simple console-based calculator.

This GNU version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional
bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard.

This package also includes dc, another arbitrary precision calculator.
Dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited
precision arithmetic.  It also allows you to define and call macros.
