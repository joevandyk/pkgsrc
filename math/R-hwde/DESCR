Models and tests for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and
independence between loci.

Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in Huttley and
Wilson (2000), Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson (1986). Contrast terms
are available that account for first order interactions between loci.
