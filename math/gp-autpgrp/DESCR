AutPGrp is a GAP 4 package for computing automorphism groups of p-groups.

In the AutPGrp package we introduce a new function to compute the
automorphism group of a finite p-group. The underlying algorithm is a
refinement of the methods described in O'Brien (1995). In particular,
this implementation is more efficient in both time and space requirements
and hence has a wider range of applications than the ANU pq method. Our
package is written in GAP code and it makes use of a number of methods
from the GAP library such as the MeatAxe for matrix groups and
permutation group functions.
