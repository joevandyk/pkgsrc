SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) is a software simulator for
neural networks on Unix workstations developed at the Institute for
Parallel and Distributed High Performance Systems (IPVR) at the
University of Stuttgart. The goal of the SNNS project is to create
an efficient and flexible simulation environment for research on
and application of neural nets.
