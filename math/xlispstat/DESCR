XLISP-STAT is a statistical environment based on a dialect of the Lisp
language called XLISP.  To facilitate statistical computations, standard Lisp
functions for addition, logarithms, etc., have been modified to operate on
lists and arrays of numbers, and a number of basic statistical functions have
been added.

A tutorial introduction to the system is available. It is written
primarily for the Macintosh version, but the differences to the UNIX
version are minor; see below. The tutorial is available as a set of
LaTeX files in xlispstat.doc.tar.Z at the ftp address above.
