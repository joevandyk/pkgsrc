The Unidata units library, udunits, supports conversion of unit
specifications between formatted and binary forms, arithmetic
manipulation of unit specifications, and conversion of values between
compatible scales of measurement.

The udunits package consists of the library, a unit conversion
program, and a Perl module which provides an interface to the udunits
library.
