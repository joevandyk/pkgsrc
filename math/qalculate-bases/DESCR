Qalculate! Bases is a utility for conversion between number bases using the
Qalculate! library. It presents the user with a small dialog with entries for
binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal numbers. When a number or mathematical
expression (using the full capabilities of Qalculate!) is typed in any of the
entries the others are updated as-you-type.
