SuperLU contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP).  The
columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the preordering
for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with standard
ANSI C compilers. It provides functionality for both real and complex
matrices, in both single and double precision.
