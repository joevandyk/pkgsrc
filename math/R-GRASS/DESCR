Interface between GRASS 5.0 geographical information system
and R, based on starting R from within the GRASS environment
using values of environment variables set in the GISRC file.
Interface examples should be run outside GRASS, others may
be run within. Wrapper and helper functions are provided for
a range of R functions to match the interface metadata
structures.
