  Statist is a small and portable statistics program written in C.  It is
terminal-based, but can utilise GNUplot for plotting purposes.  It is
simple to use and can be run in scripts. Big datasets are handled
reasonably well on small machines.

  In spite of its low overhead, statist can do quite a bunch of regression
functions and tests in a comprehensible way. It is quite powerful.
