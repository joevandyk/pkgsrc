Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible
computer algebra language. The syntax uses a infix-operator grammar
parser. The distribution contains a small library of mathematical functions,
but its real strength is in the language in which you can easily write your
own symbolic manipulation algorithms. It supports arbitrary precision
arithmetic.

The current version is 1.0.28 (the first release was 1.0.0). The language is
very much in a finished state. Any code written for it should be usable in
future versions. Also, the language should prove very easy to learn.

Yacas is written in very clean c++ code, and is very portable . It can compile
stand-alone, and is easily embeddable. Yacas contains a native arbitrary
precision arithmetic module, but can also be used with GMP.

Things implemented include: arbitrary precision, rational numeric, vector,
complex, and matrix computations (including inverses and determinants and
solving matrix equations), derivatives, solving, Taylor series, numerical
solving (Newtons method), and a lot more non-mathematical algorithms. The
language natively supports variables and user-defined functions. There is
basic support for polynomials.
