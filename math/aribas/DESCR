ARIBAS is an interactive interpreter for big integer arithmetic
and multi-precision floating point arithmetic with a Pascal/Modula
like syntax. It has several builtin functions for algorithmic number
theory like gcd, Jacobi symbol, Rabin probabilistic prime test,
factorization algorithms (Pollard rho, continued fraction,
quadratic sieve), etc.

ARIBAS is used for the examples of number theoretic algorithms in the book
Algorithmische Zahlentheorie by O. Forster.

A GNU Emacs mode is also included.
