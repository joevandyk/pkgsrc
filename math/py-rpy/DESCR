RPy is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R
Programming Language. It can manage all kinds of R objects and can
execute arbitrary R functions (including the graphic functions).
All the errors from the R language are converted to Python exceptions.
Any modules that later were installed on the R system, can easily
be used from within Python, without introducing any changes.
