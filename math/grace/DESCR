Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific data. It runs
under various (if not all) flavours of UNIX with X11 and Motif. Its
capabilities are roughly similar to GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or
Microcal Origin plus script-based tools like gnuplot or Genplot.  Its
strength lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a graphical
user interface with the power of a scripting language which enables it to do
sophisticated calculations or perform automated tasks.

Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally written by Paul Turner.
