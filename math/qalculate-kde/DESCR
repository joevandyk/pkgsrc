Qalculate! is a modern multi-purpose desktop calculator for GNU/Linux.
It is small and simple to use but with much power and versatility underneath.
Features include customizable functions, units, arbitrary precision, plotting,
and a graphical interface (GTK+) that uses a one-line fault-tolerant expression
entry (although it supports optional traditional buttons).
