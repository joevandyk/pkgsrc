This is the perl fnet client for those times when you just don't want to
compile fnet on your target machine.  It was written primarily as an easy
way to interface bots and intelligence into a standard client without the
pain of C's string handling.  However, perl runs so large that in good
conscience I can't suggest that one run this all of the time.

As the author uses only the old C client, none of the fancy schmancy
TCL commands have been included here.  This release is a full featured
client with most commands.
