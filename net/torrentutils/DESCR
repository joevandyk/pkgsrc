The torrentutils are a set of utilities for managing BitTorrent
(`.torrent') files and interactiving with BitTorrent trackers.
The torrentutils contain the following programs:

torrenttool is a script that extracts and displays information from
BitTorrent files, as well as testing and generate checksums for
files listed in them.

defrag is a script that defrags files simply by making a copy of
the file. The original file is then replaced by the copy. Due to
the fact that BitTorrent splits files in pieces, and downloads
these pieces in random order, the downloaded files are often severely
fragmented. This means that reading these files will be slower,
sometimes as much as 30% slower. defrag can also recurse directories.
