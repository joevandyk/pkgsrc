DGD (Dworkin's Generic Driver, also known as Dworkin's Game Driver)
is an object-oriented programmable server.  It is a re-implementation
from scratch of the LPMud server created by Lars Pensjoe.  However,
rather than embracing and extending LPMud 3.1.2, the last version of
LPMud created by Lars, DGD departs from LPMud at an earlier version,
2.4.5.

Please report bugs to <felix@dworkin.nl>.
