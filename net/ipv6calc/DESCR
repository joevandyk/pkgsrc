ipv6calc is a small utility in C to manipulate IPv6 addresses. The intentions
were to convert a given IPv6 address into compressed format, convert a given
IPv6 address into the same format like shown in Linux' /proc/net/if_inet6 and
(because it was not difficulty) migrate ip6_int into. Now only one utility is
needed to do a lot (perhaps the features grow on demand in the future).

This utility will be used in the future to extend features on
network-functions-ipv6.
