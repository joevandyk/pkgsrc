Xorp (pronounced z-o-r-p) is an open router software platform being
developed primarily at the International Computer Science Institute
in Berkeley.  The goal is to produce a complete set of router
software that is stable enough and fully featured enough for
production use, initially on edge routers, but also due to our
focus on extensibility, to be an excellent platform for Internet
research.
