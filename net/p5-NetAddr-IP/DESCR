This  Perl5 module  is  designed as  a  help  for  managing (ranges
of) IP addresses. It includes efficient implementations for most
common tasks done  to subnets or  ranges of  IP addresses,  namely
verifying  if an address is within a subnet, comparing, looping,
splitting subnets into longer prefixes, compacting addresses to
the shortest prefixes, etc. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
supported.
