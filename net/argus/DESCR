Argus is a system and network monitoring application. It will monitor
anything you ask it to monitor (TCP + UDP applications, IP connectivity,
SNMP OIDS, Programs, Databases, etc), presents a nice clean, easy to view
web interface, it can send alerts numerous ways (such as via pager) and
can automatically escalate if someone falls asleep.
