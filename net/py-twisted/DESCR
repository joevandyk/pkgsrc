Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications.
It includes implementations of a number of commonly used network services such
as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail server, a relational database
interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications using all of
these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted
also includes a user authentication system that controls access to services
and provides services with user context information to implement their own
security models.
