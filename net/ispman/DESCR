  ISPman is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend
to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual
hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.

  ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where
between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing.
Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed
an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk
can easily manage the domains and users.

  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be
scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is
written with scalibility and High availibility in mind.

  This may not be the right software for you if you want to run a small ISP on
a single box or if you want to use this software as an LDAP editor or a DNS
management software by itself.
