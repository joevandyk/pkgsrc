httptunnel creates a bi-directional virtual data connection tunnelled
in HTTP requests. The HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy
if so desired.

This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls. If WWW
access is allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's possible to use
httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to a computer outside
the firewall.

httptunnel is written and maintained by Lars Brinkhoff. See the
file AUTHORS in the tarball for more information about contributors
to this package.
