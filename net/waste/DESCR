WASTE is a software product and protocol that enables secure distributed
communication for small (on the order of 10-50 nodes) trusted groups of users.

WASTE is designed to enable small companies and small teams within larger
companies to easily communicate and collaborate in a secure and efficient
fashion, independent of physical network topology.
