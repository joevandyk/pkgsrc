LibBT is a C reimplementation of the BitTorrent core protocols.  Our
goal for the project is to develop a low overhead library version of
the protocols so that BitTorrent transfers can easily be built in to
any existing application.

A suplied application called `btget' is a full fledged bittorrent
application based on this library.
