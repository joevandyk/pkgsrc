PoPToP is the PPTP server solution for Linux (ports exist for Solaris 2.6,
OpenBSD and FreeBSD and others).  To date no real solution existed if you
wished to include Linux servers in PPTP established VPNs.  PoPToP resolves
that problem by allowing Linux servers to function seamlessly in the PPTP
VPN environment.  This enables administrators to leverage the considerable
benefits of both Microsoft and Linux.  The current pre-release version
supports Windows 95/98/NT/2000 PPTP clients and PPTP Linux clients.  PoPToP
is free GNU software.

The PoPTop pre-release server is not yet fully optimised.  It has been
released early so as to encourage other developers to become involved in
its development.  On release, PoPToP will be fully compliant with IETF PPTP
Internet Draft and it will seamlessly support Windows PPTP clients with the
full range of encryption and authentication features.

Features for version 1.0.0:
- Works with Windows 2000 clients
- Available PPPD patch allows Windows compatible encryption and
  authentication. (MSCHAPv2 and MPPE 40-128 bit RC4 encryption)
- Support for multiple clients
- Works with Windows 95/98/NT PPTP clients
- Works with C. S. Ananian's PPTP Linux clients
- PoPToP is, and will remain, totally free under the GNU General
