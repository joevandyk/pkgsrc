i frequently want to know what the top few network flows are... and yet
there didn't seem to be any tool which was as simple to use as "vmstat"
or "iostat".  this tool fills that void for me.

with the default options flodo will dump the top 20 flows every 5 seconds.

flodo is quite basic at this point, understanding only ethernet frames,
ipv4, tcp, and udp.

flodo can't even do reverse DNS and doesn't bother mapping port numbers
to services or display icmp or ethernet protocol names.
