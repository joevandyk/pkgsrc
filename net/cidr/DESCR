cidr is a tiny command-line tool for determining network and broadcast
addresses a la RFC 1878.  It takes an IP address and netmask and
outputs the network address, broadcast address, and total number of
addresses for the corresponding subnet.  The IP can be in binary,
decimal, hex, or dotted quad.  The mask can be in binary, decimal, hex,
dotted quad, or prefix.
