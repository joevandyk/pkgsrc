ENTROPY stands for Emerging Network To Reduce Orwellian Potency Yield and as
such describes the main goal of the project.

ENTROPY is developed as a response to increasing censorship and surveillance
in the internet. The program connects your computer to a network of machines
which all run this software. The ENTROPY network is running parallel to the
WWW and also other internet services like FTP, email, ICQ. etc.

For the user the ENTROPY network looks like a collection of WWW pages. The
difference to the WWW however is that there are no accesses to central
servers. And this is why there is no site operator who could log who
downloaded what and when. Every computer taking part in the ENTROPY network
(every node) is at the same time server, router for other nodes, caching
proxy and client for the user: that is You.
