NOTE:  Entropy is currently a project under rapid development.  Sometimes
the network protocol changes, requiring an upgrade.  Please keep watch on
this package and update it whenever a newer version is available.

You will need to copy the contents of

    ${PREFIX}/share/examples/entropy

to a new, writable directory, and edit "entropy.conf".  Once done, you
may run "entropy" to start the daemon, or "entropy -k" to stop it.
The option "-v" may be added for verbose start/stop messages.
