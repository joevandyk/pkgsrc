aria2 is a utility for downloading files. It has completely new design
concept from its predecessor, Aria, and is written from scratch. aria2
has a segmented downloading engine in its core. It can download one
file from multiple URLs or multiple connections from one URL. This
results in very high speed downloading, much faster than ordinary
browsers. This engine in was implemented in a single-thread model. The
architecture is clean and easy to extend. aria2 currently supports
HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent. It also supports Metalink version 3.0.
