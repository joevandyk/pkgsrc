The most important tools for those who want to insert their own content as a
website into Freenet or Entropy, are the Freenet Tools (or similiar tools
from other authors :). For Freenet, there are some such programs linked from
their http://freenetproject.org) pages. Not many of them will work with
Entropy out-of-the-box, as they sometimes specialize on minor deviations in
the FCP interface. Specificially the newer tools, supporting the FEC FCP
v1.1 will fail with Entropy, as Entropy does not yet fully support the
changes to the Freenet Client Protocol. So I suggest you use ft for Entropy
for now, since I can help you there with problems or questions.
