This is arpwatch and arpsnmp, tools that monitors ethernet activity
and maintain a database of ethernet/ip address pairings. It also
reports certain changes via email.

Arpsnmp has the same database features of arpwatch but relies on an
external agent to collect the arp data. This distribution contains a
script, arpfetch, that uses snmpwalk from the CMU SNMP package.
