tkined is a graphical tool based on scotty which allows you to
troubleshoot your IP network (ping, traceroute, finger, query tcp
services, query RPC services) and monitor network status plus
scripts to discover and layout the topology of your IP network. SNMP
based scripts can be used to dump routing tables, to query interface
status and to monitor SNMP variables. There is also a MIB browser to
inspect the MIB hierarchy.
