The Switch Digger works on the premise that today's routers and switches
are chock-full of information that very few people use.  It puts that data
to good use and cross-references what the network knows with what it knows
to arrive at the closest possible location.

This program is designed to track down computers to the finest level of
information available at the moment.  Sometimes this can mean an exact
description of a port in a building anywhere in an enterprise.  Other
times this may just be a vague notion of a faraway network.  The results
are only as good as the data you feed to it.
