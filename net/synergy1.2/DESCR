With synergy, all the computers on your desktop form a single virtual
screen.  You use the mouse and keyboard of only one of the computers
while you use all of the monitors on all of the computers.  You tell
synergy how many screens you have and their positions relative to one
another.  Synergy then detects when the mouse moves off the edge of a
screen and jumps it instantly to the neighboring screen.  The keyboard
works normally on each screen; input goes to whichever screen has the
cursor.
