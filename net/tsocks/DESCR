tsocks allows non SOCKS aware applications (e.g telnet, ssh, ftp etc) to use
SOCKS without any modification.  It does this by intercepting the calls that
applications make to establish network connections and negotiating them through
a SOCKS server as necessary.

tsocks is based on the 'shared library interceptor' concept.  Through use of
the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, tsocks is automatically loaded into the
process space of every executed program.
