Pavel occasionally extracts a useful subset of the LambdaMOO (the site)
database, which can then be fetched by others and used to start a new
server running LambdaMOO (the software). This starting database is
called "LambdaCore". (Often people on LambdaMOO and other MOOs will
refer to this part of the database as simply "the core".) It includes
utility objects for manipulating strings and other data, generic
classes for users and rooms and so on, objects that provide access to
Gopher and other Internet services, a mail/newsgroup system, an
extensive help system, and, well, generally a lot of stuff.
