  The portable SDK for UPnP* Devices (libupnp) provides developers with an
API and open source code for building control points, devices, and bridges
that are compliant with Version 1.0 of the Universal Plug and Play Device
Architecture Specification and support several operating systems like
Linux, *BSD, Solaris and others.

  UPnP is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and
control of devices on a network, independent of operating system,
programming language, or physical network connection.  UPnP is based on
common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML.
