DCTC is a Direct Connect clone, a windows client allowing users to
share their files and talk (like IRC but more software sharing
oriented) using a proprietary protocol.

DCTC stands for Direct Connect Text Client.

DCTC is not designed to be used by human. It doesn't contains any
GUI or CLI. The goal of this project is to build a Direct Connect
client which can be used by other programs. So even if you can
enter command using the keyboard, don't say the human interface is
poor.
