ftplibpp is a C++ class providing ftp client functionality. It is a
direct derivate from the great ftplib C library by Thomas Pfau. It was
ported to C++, modified and some features added to fit today's FTP
standards, like resuming up- and downloads, fxp support, SSL/TLS encryption
and logging functionality. However the very base of ftplibpp is still the
nice code from Thomas Pfau.
