Batchftp is a C program which automates the ftp process on Berkeley
UNIX systems. A user is able to upload and download files from almost
any remote computer without monitoring the transfer. A user simply
enters the commands or files to be retrieved in an input file. Then,
the program will log onto the specified computer (not necessarily a
ftp site) and execute the given commands. Since Batchftp can run in
the background, a user is free to do other things while the transfer
sessions are taking place. More importantly, it will not give up until
a successful connection has been established with the remote
site. However, execution will be temporarily suspended after a given
number of failures; connection attempts will resume after the extended
delay.
