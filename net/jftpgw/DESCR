jftpgw is an FTP proxy/gateway that uses the FTP protocol (unlike
those FTP proxies that fetch an FTP file but work as an http proxy).
You can use it to make servers behind a firewall/NAT server
(masquerading server) accessible or to allow users behind such
solutions to transfer files to and from the outside of the LAN.
