CTorrent is a BitTorrent client written in the C programming language.
It currently runs on most Linux variants, MacOS and FreeBSD, but
hopefully on Windows as well! CTorrent is built as a console program,
which means that it doesn't require any graphical components (such as an
X server) on the machine you are running it on, you can even run it
remotely through a terminal if you wish.
