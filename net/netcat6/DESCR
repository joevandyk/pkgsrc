Netcat6 is a total rewrite of netcat, with several advantages:

 * It fully supports IPv6.
 * It is far more efficient, utilizing flexible buffering and minimal (or
   no) data copying or analysis.
 * The source is well structured, documented and very easy to follow. One of
   the main objectives of netcat6 is to produce an excellent example of AF
   independent networking and efficient data transfer. The code has minimal
   dependency on the address family or protocol type and can be trivially
   extended to talk many layer 3 protocols.
 * Greatly improved configuration and platform independence.
 * Can support servers or clients that use TCP half-close.

Some features of the original netcat are not present in netcat6, either because
they haven't yet been implemented or because there exists better tools for the
job. See the TODO file included in the netcat6 package for more information.
