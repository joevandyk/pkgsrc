Samba is a suite of programs which work together to allow clients to
access to a server's filespace and printers via the SMB (Server
Message Block) protocol.

In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to
Unix disks and printers from Lan Manager clients, Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows NT clients, Linux clients and OS/2
clients. There is also a generic Unix client program supplied as part
of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to
access filespace and printers on any other SMB servers. This gives the
capability for these operating systems to behave much like a LAN
Server or Windows NT Server machine, only with added functionality and
flexibility designed to make life easier for administrators.

This package contains a modified version of Samba developed by the Samba
Users Group Japan and supports I18N for SWAT and the use of localized
(Japanese) character encoding.
