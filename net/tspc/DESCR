Freenet6 is a free IPv6 access service offered by Hexago. This service enables
thousands of people from all over the world to experience the best solution for
a smooth and incremental deployment of IPv6.

Instead of a Web interface, which is usually offered by traditional tunnel
brokers, Freenet6 uses an innovative model based on the TSP Client. The TSP
Client is software that usually runs on a PC and that implements the Tunnel
Setup Protocol (TSP). The TSP Client is used to automatically negotiate a
configured tunnel between a PC or router and the Freenet6 tunnel broker, making
IPv6 easy to install and maintain. The TSP Client source code is licensed under
the GPL. A commercial license is also available.
