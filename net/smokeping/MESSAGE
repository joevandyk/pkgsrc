Smokeping is now installed.
The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/smokeping/

A sample config file can be found in:
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/smokeping/config.dist

A copy has been installed as ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config and you will
need to adjust it as needed.  You may also want to have a look at
basepage.html and smokemail in this directory.

Make sure that your web's server /cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi refers to
${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi, or copy the smokeping in your
web server's cgi space.

You will need to make smokeping accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/smokeping.conf

to make smokeping accessible through:

	http://localhost/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi

Please remember to grant write permissions to the following directory for
the user your web server runs as:

	${PREFIX}/share/smokeping/.simg
