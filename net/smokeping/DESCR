SmokePing can measure latency, latency distribution and packet loss
in your network. SmokePing uses RRDtool to maintain a longterm datastore
and to draw pretty graphs, giving up to the minute information
on the state of each network connection. SmokePing can also raise
alarms based on latency and loss patterns.
