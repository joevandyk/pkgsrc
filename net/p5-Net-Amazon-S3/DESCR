This module provides a Perlish interface to Amazon S3. From the
developer blurb: "Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed
to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a
simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any
amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any
developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of
scale and to pass those benefits on to developers".
