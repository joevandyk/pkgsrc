scotty - network management extensions to tcl

scotty is a tcl extension which allows to set up TCP and UDP
connections, to send various ICMP packets, to query the domain name
system (DNS), to check clock screw using the NTP protocol and to query
various SUN RPC services (like rstat and mountd).

Included in this package is an interface to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. The
SNMP stack was written from scratch to provide an efficient and
portable tcl SNMP extension. MIB extensions can be written in tcl by
running the scotty extension as an SNMP agent. This allows you to
implement your own specific MIB without getting in contact with the
lowlevel ASN.1/BER stuff.

tkined, a very nice graphical network monitoring tool based on scotty
is available as pkgsrc/net/tkined.
