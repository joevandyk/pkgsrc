        NAME

<b>hf6to4</b>
- setup automatic 6to4 IPv6 tunnelling
        <h3>
        SYNOPSIS
        </h3>
<b>hf6to4</b>
[<b>-</b><b></b><b>vn</b>]
<i></i><i>command</i>
        <h3>
        DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
The
<b>hf6to4</b>
script can be used to setup IPv6 on your home machine and
network for exploring IPv6 without any registrations. 6to4 is a
mechanism by which your IPv6 address(es) are derived from an assigned
IPv4 address, and which involves automatic tunnelling to one or more
remove 6to4 relay routers, which will then forward your v6 packets on the 6bone.
Replies are routed back to you over IPv4 via (possibly) other
6to4 relay routers. As such, IPv6-in-IPv4-encapsulated
packets are accepted from all v4-hosts. See
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
for security discussion.
        <p>
From your (single) IPv4 address, you get a whole IPv6 /48 network,
which allows you to split your network in 2^16 subnets, with 2^64
hosts each. You need to setup routing for your internal network
properly, help is provided for setting up the border router here.
        <p>
This script takes the burden to calculate your IPv6 address from
existing IPv4 address and runs the commands to setup (and tear down)
automatic 6to4 IPv6 tunnelling. In a separate step, router
advertisement for the inside network can be started and stopped.
        <p>
Possible options are:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-</b><b></b><b>n</b><dd>
Do not. Only print the commands that would be run, but do not execute
them.
<p><dt><b>-</b><b></b><b>v</b><dd>
Verbose operation. Print the commands that are about to be run, before
running them. Displays some additional information.
<p><dt><b>-</b><b></b><b>h</b><dd>
Show usage.
</dl>
        <p>
Possible commands are:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>start</b><dd>
Same as
<b></b><b>stf-start</b>.
<p><dt><b></b><b>stop</b><dd>
Same as
<b></b><b>stf-stop</b>.
<p><dt><b></b><b>stf-start</b><dd>
Configure 6to4 IPv6. The
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
interface is configured, and a default route to a remote 6to4
gateway is established. In addition, the internal
network interface is assigned an address.
<p><dt><b></b><b>stf-stop</b><dd>
Stops 6to4 IPv6. All addresses are removed from the
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
device, and the default route is removed. If
<b></b><b>in_if</b>
is set, the 6to4 addresses are removed from that interface too.
<p><dt><b></b><b>rtadvd-start</b><dd>
Starts router advertizement and IPv6 packet forwarding,
turning the machine into a IPv6 router.
Clients just need to be told to accept router advertizements, i.e.
the
`net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv'
sysctl needs to be set to
`1'.
On NetBSD, you can arrange that by setting
``ip6mode=autohost''
in
<code></code><code>/etc/rc.conf</code>.
<p><dt><b></b><b>rtadvd-stop</b><dd>
Stops router advertizement and IPv6 packet forwarding.
<a href="../html8/rtadvd.html">rtadvd(8)</a>
is stopped.
</dl>
        <h3>
        REQUIREMENTS
        </h3>
Besides IPv4 connectivity, you need support for IPv6 and the
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
device in your kernel. While the GENERIC
NetBSD
1.5 kernel does support IPv6, it does not contain support for the
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
device.
        <p>
Make sure you have the following options in your kernel config file:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
options         INET            # IP + ICMP + TCP + UDP
options         INET6           # IPV6
pseudo-device   stf     1       # 6to4 IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
        <p>
In systems that run past-1.5,
you will have to explicitly create an
<a href="../html4/stf.html">stf(4)</a>
device after compiling it in the kernel. You do this by running
the following command before calling the
<b>hf6to4</b>
script:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
ifconfig stf0 create
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
As an alternative, you can also put the following lines into
<code></code><code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
net_interfaces="stf0"
ifconfig_stf0="create"
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
        <p>
See also the comment on setting up IPv6-clients
`behind'
your 6to4 router for the
<b></b><b>rtadvd-start</b>
command!
        <h3>
        CONFIGURATION
        </h3>
The
<b>hf6to4</b>
script reads its configuration from a config file named
<code></code><code>hf6to4.conf</code>.
The
<code></code><code>hf6to4.conf</code>
file is in
<a href="../html1/sh.html">sh(1)</a>
syntax, and contains several
variables that can be tuned to adjust your setup. Default values
should work for use on a modem/DSL dialup.
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>out_if</b><dd>
The outbound interface that has a valid IPv4 address
assigned, that can be used to derive the IPv6
addresses from. Usually
``ppp0''
for a modem setup, or your ethernet interface if you have
IPv4 connectivity via LAN. This
can't be empty, and is assigned the IPv6 address
2002:x:x:v6_net:hostbits6, see below.
<p><dt><b></b><b>in_if</b><dd>
The inside interface. If non-empty, this interface is
assigned the IPv6 address
2002:x:x:v6_innernet:hostbits6, see below.
This is only useful on machines that
have more than one network interfaces, e.g. with a modem and a
local ethernet.
<p><dt><b></b><b>v6_net</b><dd>
The subnet address you want to use on the address of
your outbound interface. Defaults to
``1''.
<p><dt><b></b><b>v6_innernet</b><dd>
The subnet address you want to use on the address of
your inbound interface. Defaults to
``2''.
<p><dt><b></b><b>hostbits6</b><dd>
The lower 64 bits of both the inbound and outbound interface's
addresses.
<p><dt><b></b><b>peer</b><dd>
Name of the remote 6to4 server that'll take our
IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulated packets and route them on
via IPv6. A special value of
``6to4-anycast''
can be used for the anycast service defined in RFC 3068.
Other possible values are given in the example config file.
<p><dt><b></b><b>remoteadr4,</b><b> remoteadr6</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>peer</b>
variable is set to the relay router's name, DNS lookups for A and AAAA
records will be made to
determine its IPv4 and IPv6 address.  To avoid these lookups, the variables
<b></b><b>remoteadr4</b>
and
<b></b><b>remoteadr6</b>
can be set to strings containing the numerical IPv4 and IPv6 numbers
directly.
</dl>
        <h3>
        EXAMPLES
        </h3>
The
<b>hf6to4</b>
script can be run automatically by
<a href="../html8/pppd.html">pppd(8)</a>
when a connection is made. For this, put the following into
<code></code><code>/etc/ppp/ip-up</code>:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
( /usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 stf-stop
  /usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 stf-start
  /usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 rtadvd-stop
  /usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 rtadvd-start ) &
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
        <p>
To shut down properly, put this into
<code></code><code>/etc/ppp/ip-down</code>:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
/usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 stf-stop
/usr/pkg/sbin/hf6to4 rtadvd-stop
</pre>
</code>
</dl>

        <h3>
        HISTORY
        </h3>
The
<b>hf6to4</b>
utility and manpage were written by
Hubert Feyrer <hubert@feyrer.de>.
        <p>
The utility was initially written in perl and called
``6to4''
but later rewritten as shell script and renamed to a name different
than the protocol it configures to emphasize the difference
between the protocol (6to4) and the implementation (hf6to4).
        <p>
The older (perl) version is also shipped by Apple with versions
10.3 and 10.4 (and probably newer) of their MacOS X operating system.
        <h3>
        BUGS
        </h3>
On systems running past-1.5, the
``ifconfig stf0 create''
should be run automatically.
        <p>
Might be good to use /etc/rc.d/rtadvd for rtadvd handling.
