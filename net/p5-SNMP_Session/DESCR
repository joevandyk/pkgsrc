This module differs from existing SNMP packages in that it is
completely stand-alone, i.e. you don't need to have another SNMP
package such as CMU SNMP.  It is also written entirely in Perl, so you
don't have to compile any C modules.  It uses the Perl 5 Socket.pm
module and should therefore be very portable, even to non-Unix systems.

The SNMP operations currently supported are "get", "get-next", and
"set", as well as trap generation and reception.

For an excellent example of the type of application this is useful
for, see Tobias Oetiker's ``mrtg'' (Multi Router Traffic Grapher)
