IRRToolSet is a suite of policy analysis tools to operate with
routing policies in RPSL [RFC 2622] format, registered in an
Internet Routing Registry(IRR). The main goal of the project is
to make routing information more convenient and useful for
network engineers, by providing tools for automated router configuration,
routing policies analysis, and maintenance.

This package contains the programs RtConfig, CIDRAdvisor, peval, prtraceroute,
prpath and rpslcheck (aka prcheck). It doesn't try to build aoe and roe,
which want TCL/TK (and X).

IRRToolSet started life as RAToolSet from ISI.edu, was then kept by RIPE NCC
for a while, and lately transferred to ISC.
