SETI@home is a scientific experiment that uses Internet-connected computers
in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). You can participate
by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data.
This version of SETI@home is based on BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure
for Network Computing). Several other projects besides SETI@home are
using BOINC. BOINC lets you participate in more than one project, and it
lets you specify what fraction of your computer time should go to each project.
