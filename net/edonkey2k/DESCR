eDonkey2000 doesn't rely on one central server yet searches are
quick and your client doesn't get bogged down with endless search
requests. You have the ability to search all the files being shared
anywhere on the eDonkey2000 network.

It allows you to transfer any type of file. It automatically resumes
interrupted transfers from alternate sources. It even introduces
ways to share a whole collection of files together so you can be
sure to get all the songs in an album or all pieces of a movie.
Users will be able to download a file from multiple sources at the
same time thus insuring that transfers will be as fast as possible.
