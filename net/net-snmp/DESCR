Net-SNMP contains various tools relating to the Simple Network Management
Protocol including:

	* an extensible agent
	* an SNMP library
	* tools to request or set information from SNMP agents
	* tools to generate and handle SNMP traps
	* a version of the unix 'netstat' command using SNMP

This package is originally based on the Carnegie Mellon University
SNMP implementation (version 2.1.2.1), but has developed significantly
since then.
