This is an all-new, modern Gopher server.  It can serve documents
with Gopher+, standard Gopher (RFC1436), and HTTP -- all on the same
port.  Pygopherd features a modular extension system as well as
loadable scripts and much more.  It contains full support for
UMN gopherd systems -- including .Links, .names, .cap, searches, etc.
Pygopherd also supports Bucktooth features such as gophermap files
and executables.  In addition to all this, there are Pygopherd's own
extra features.  All features are fully customizable and can be enabled
or disabled by editing /etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf.
