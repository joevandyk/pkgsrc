Dynip(sm) is a Dynamic IP Management System which allows Internet
hosts with dynamic IP addresses, such as dial-up users, to have a
permanent static Internet Name. Now, you  can register  your  own
personal  Internet Name  that  constantly  refers to your dynamic
IP  address, anywhere in the world!  Your Internet Name   becomes
integrated   into   the existing Domain Name  System (DNS) on the
Internet  within  seconds  of  your   name  registration!  People
can  refer  to  your machine by means of a simple static Internet
name, allowing you to make your  own unix  servers  available  to
the  public  by publishing your Internet name.  You  never  again
have to post your  dynamic  IP  address  to  a web page, or run a
silly finger server  informing others of your current IP address.
