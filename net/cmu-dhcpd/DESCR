CMU dhcpd 3.3.7 is a combined BootP and DHCP server, available from
Carnegie Mellon University.

Development of this sofware at CMU has been halted.  At Princeton
we've added a few new features, and fixed some bugs (and probably
introduced new ones, naturally).  We've also incorporated patches
that others have posted.
