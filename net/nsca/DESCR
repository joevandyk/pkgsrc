  Nsca is an add-on for NetSaint that allows you to send passive service
check  results from remote hosts to a central monitoring host that runs
NetSaint.  The client can be used as a standalone program or can be
integrated with remote NetSaint servers that run an ocsp command to setup
a distributed monitoring environment.
