LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that
often works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method)
and goes through many configurations of packet-filter based firewalls.
More importantly, LFT implements numerous other features including AS
number lookups, loose source routing, netblock name lookups, et al.
