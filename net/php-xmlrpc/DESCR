PHP is a programming language designed to be embedded into web pages.

This PHP extension provides functions to write XML-RPC servers and clients.
You can find more information about XML-RPC at http://www.xmlrpc.com/,
and more documentation on this extension and its functions at home page.

The user of this library will typically be implementing either an
XMLRPC server, an XMLRPC client, or both. The client will use the
library to build an in-memory representation of a request, and then
serialize (encode) that request into XML. The client will then send
the XML to the server via external mechanism. (XMLRPC-EPI does
*not* include a transport layer, not even HTTP.) The server will
de-serialize the XML back into an binary representation, call the
appropriate registered method -- thereby generating a response.
The response will be serialized into XML and sent back to the
client. The client will de-serialize it into memory, and can iterate
through the results via API.
