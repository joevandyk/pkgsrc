Inetd Configuration:

If you plan on running nsca under inetd or xinetd and making use
of TCP wrappers, you need to do the following things:



1) Add a line to your /etc/services file as follows (modify the port
   number as you see fit)

  nsca            5667/tcp        # NSCA

2) Add an entry to /etc/inetd.conf as follows:


  nsca    stream  tcp     nowait  <user> <nscabin> nsca -c <nscacfg> --inetd


   - Replace <user> with the name of the user that nsca server should run as.
   - Replace <nscabin> with the path to the nsca binary on your system.
   - Replace <nscacfg> with the path to the nsca config file on your system.
