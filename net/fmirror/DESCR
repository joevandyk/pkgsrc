fmirror is a program for mirroring files and directories from a remote
ftp server. It allows regex-matching for files that are to be included
and excluded. It uses a combination of timestamp, file size and file
permissions to decide what files to transfer from the ftp server.

The primary goal of fmirror is to use as little memory as possible,
but still be able to do its job efficiently.
