This module allows users to communicate with eBay using perl and
their XML based eBay API. You can use it to list items for sale,
bid, get seller item list, search, get ebay time, or do anything
else.

Many details of this API can be found at http://developer.ebay.com.
To be able to use this module, you need to register there and obtain
keys and a authentication token using "tokentool".

The job of its module is to encapsulate connectivity and authentication,
and communication with ebay. First, you need to initialize your
ebay connection by passing it credentials. After that, you can send
queries to eBay. A typical request is comprised of its name, and
a hash table of application parameters.
