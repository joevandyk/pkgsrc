gethost does hostname and IP lookups. It supports IPv6.
It uses standard libraries and it doesn't necessarily
use DNS resolver only. So it is useful for troubleshooting
/etc/hosts, for example. gethost can also time each lookup
to show the elapsed time in seconds. Multiple lookups
can be done on one command-line.
