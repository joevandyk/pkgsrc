This Nagios addon is designed to provide a way for executing plugins on
a remote host. The check_nrpe plugin runs on the Nagios host and is used
to send plugin execution requests to the nrpe agent on the remote
host. The nrpe agent will then run an appropriate plugins on the
remote host and return the plugin output and return code to the
check_nrpe plugin on the Nagios host.
