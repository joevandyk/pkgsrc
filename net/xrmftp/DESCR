Xrmftp is FTP client for UNIX with graphical interface. Its main features
in my opinion are:
    * During transfer you can detach from X-server and continue transfer.
      This feature is useful for people who don't have permanent access to
      X-terminal.
    * Upload and download with directory structure.
    * You can resume transfer if file was truncated.
    * Listings of visited directories are cached.
    * You can 'walk around' directory tree and put files you want to download
      into buffer and then download them all together.
