Darwin Streaming Server is an open source project intended for developers who
need to stream QuickTime and MPEG-4 media on alternative platforms such as
Windows, Linux, and Solaris, or those developers who need to extend and/or
modify the existing streaming server code to fit their needs. Darwin Streaming
Server is only supported by the open source community and is not eligible for
technical support from Apple. Apple hosts a number of email discussion lists
for Darwin Streaming Server users and developers to share ideas and discuss
deployment scenarios.
