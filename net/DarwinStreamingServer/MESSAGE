You need to set up a DarwinStreamingServer administrator username and
password:

	# qtpasswd -c username
	# echo admin: username > ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/streaming/qtgroups

N.B. qtpasswd will overwrite the existing file with the -c option.
The file
	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/streaming/qtgroups
will contain users separated by white space for each group.

In order to run the DarwinStreamingServer administration tools you need to
install SSL keys into
	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/streaming/streamingadminserver.pem

After the administration tools are up and running you should be able to
access them at
	http://your.hostname:1220/
If you select 'Secure Administration (SSL)' you'll be directed to
	https://your.hostname:1240/
