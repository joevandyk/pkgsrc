  NEAT (Netsaint Easy Administration Tool) is a web administration
interface for NetSaint written in Perl.  Neat allows you to
add, edit, and delete definitions in your host configuration file and
restart NetSaint upon completion of the configuration changes.

  This software does not require a database to store configuration data.
