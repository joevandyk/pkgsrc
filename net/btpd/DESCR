btpd is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands,
which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. The daemon
is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one
tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for a
torrent distribution site. Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this
client a good choice for the casual user as well.
