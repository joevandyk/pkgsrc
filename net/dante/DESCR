  Dante is a socks 4/5 proxy.  It acts as a circuit-level firewall/proxy
that can be used to provide convenient and secure network connectivity to
a wide range of hosts while requiring only the server Dante runs on to have
external network connectivity.  Once installed, Dante can in most cases be
made transparent to the clients while offering detailed access control and
logging facilities to the server administrator.

  The Dante version provided via FTP is under a BSD/CMU-type license and
comes with complete source code, for your convenience and verification
availability.
