AICCU (Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Client Utility) makes it easy for users to
get IPv6 connectivity via SixXs. After having requested an account, tunnel and
optionally a subnet, AICCU can be used to automatically configure the tunnel.
AICCU supports TIC (Tunnel Information & Control protocol), which it uses for
retrieving the tunnel configuration information, AYIYA, which allows tunnels to
be created even behind firewalls and NATs.
