The Airport Base Station Configurator is a Java application which is used
to inspect and change the configuration of Apple's Airport Base Station.
Apple itself offers software to provide this functionality; however, it
requires a Macintosh running Mac OS 8.6 or greater to run. This application,
being written entirely in Java, will run on any host which has a Java Runtime
Environment installed, including Windows-based machines and most Unix variants.

This configuration software is intended for use with the old graphite
Airport Base Station with *one* ethernet port.
