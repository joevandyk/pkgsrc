POE::Component::Client::Ident is a POE (Perl Object Environment) component
which provides a convenient way for POE applications to perform non-blocking
Ident (auth/tap) protocol remote username lookups.

The component will mainly of use to the authors of server daemons and server
components which sometimes have a requirement to confirm the username provided
by the client and, therefore, use the Ident protocol to query the remote host.
