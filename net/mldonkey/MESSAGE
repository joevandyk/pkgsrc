This package only installs mldonkey's core program, which does not have a
GUI frontend.  To ease its management, it includes an rc.d startup script
that will safely start the daemon as an independent and unprivileged user.
Once started, you will be able to access it at a later time by accessing
http://localhost:4080/.

However, if you want a GUI, install the mldonkey-gui package, which will
be able to connect to a local core as well as a remote one.
