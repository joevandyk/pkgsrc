mldonkey is a client to access the eDonkey network, a peer-to-peer
network particularly efficient for big files thanks to a multi-sources
download protocol.  It is written in Objective-Caml, and comes with
its own GTK GUI, an HTTP interface and a telnet interface.  It
works on most UNIX platforms.

This package provides mldonkey's core, which can be accessed through
a web browser.  You may want to install the mldonkey-gui package
which provides a nice graphical interface for mldonkey.
