Tsclient is a frontend for rdesktop

Features:

* GTK+-2.0
* GNOME panel applet to quickly launch saved rdp files
* supports most of the rdesktop-1.1.0 arguments
* reads .rdp files in the M$ Unicode format
* writes .rdp files in ascii (which can then be read by this
  and the M$ client)
* looks and functions very much like the M$ client
* is written in C
* features an "rdp picker" which lists .rdp files in ~/.tsclient/
  and launches rdesktop from the rdp file when selected
* VNC support as a client only (vncviewer)
