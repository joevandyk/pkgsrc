Jumpgate is a TCP connection forwarder that provides many enhancements
and improvements over the existing programs that do the same thing. It
provides an interactive mode that queries the connected party for the
forwarding information it needs. Also, there is the option to log the
entire forwarded session in a file for later inspection. Furthermore,
it can log information about the forwarded session via the syslog(3)
facility.
