  This package contains a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming,
using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP).  These libraries can
be used to build streaming applications.  The libraries are already being
used to implement applications such as "liveCaster" and "playRTPMPEG" (for
streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP).  The libraries can also be used to
stream, receive, and process MPEG or H.263+ video, and several audio
codecs.  They can easily be extended to support additional (audio or video)
codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and
servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing media
player applications, such as "MPlayer".  (For some specific examples of
how these libraries can be used, see the included test programs.)
