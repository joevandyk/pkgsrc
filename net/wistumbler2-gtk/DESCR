This is a network stumbler for WaveLAN/IEEE wireless.  WiStumbler2 is a fork
of the original wistumbler, because it seems that its development does not
progress.

The differences of this version compared to the original one are:
- GTK2 and theme support.
- Correct usage of some GTK widgets.
- Support for console mode (no X needed).
- Allow log-saving on the fly (new button).
- Some GPS pointer fixes (solves segfaults).
- Speaker beeps like windows-stumbler. (ear-wardriving)
- FreeBSD port finished.

This package is built with GTK2 and console support only.
