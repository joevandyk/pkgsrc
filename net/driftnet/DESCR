Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF
images for display.  It is an horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be
used by anyone anywhere.  It can also extract MPEG audio data from the network
and play it.  If you live in a house with thick walls, this may be a useful
way to find out about your neighbours' musical taste.
