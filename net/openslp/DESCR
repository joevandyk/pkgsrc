Service Location Protocol is an IETF standards track protocol that provides
a framework to allow networking applications to discover the existence,
location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise networks.
The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of
Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial
application.
