DNS administrators  can  use  dlint  to  scan  recursively through
the  domain  records  of the fully-qualified zone to get a report
on any errors therein.  You can scan a  zone  you  own,  or anyone
else's zone on the Internet.  dlint talks directly to a primary or
secondary  nameserver for  the  zone,  to make sure it's working
with up-to-date information.
