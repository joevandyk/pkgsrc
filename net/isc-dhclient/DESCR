This package provides the ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Client.

The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient, provides
a means for configuring one or more network interfaces using DHCP
or BOOTP, or by statically assigning an address (if these protocols
fail). The actual network configuration is done by dhclient-script.

This package contains the Client component.
