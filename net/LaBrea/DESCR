LaBrea is a program that creates a tarpit or, as some have called it,
a "sticky honeypot".  LaBrea takes over unused IP addresses on a
network and creates "virtual machines" that answer to connection
attempts.  LaBrea answers those connection attempts in a way that
causes the machine at the other end to get "stuck", sometimes for a
very long time.
