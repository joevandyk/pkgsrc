"rootprobe" is a program which measures the response time of the DNS root
name servers.  This program was developed to collect measurement data from
many locations around the world.

Our goal is to collect measurement data to understand the current status
of the root servers. (e.g., analyzing the performance and stability of the
servers, identifying under-served regions.)
The data will be a basis for discussions on various issues such as
	- how to improve the root server system as a whole
	- possible future reconfiguration of the root servers
The results will be reported to the ICANN DNS Root Server System Advisory
Committee.  The data is used only for a research purpose.

We are looking for volunteers to collect data, especially from
developing countries.
