BSD port of Roaring Penguin's pppoe client by
Geoff Mottram <minaret@sprynet.com>.

This BSD port of Roaring Penguin's PPPoE client uses the Berkeley
Packet Filter to provide direct access to the Ethernet protocol
for the pppd(8) daemon.  It adds an additional feature that is
not found in the Linux distribution for watching PPPoE packets.
Details on this feature can be found in the "PPPoE Packet Watching"
section at the bottom of this file.

The Roaring Penguin PPPoE client is a robust product that has been
widely used and tested by the Linux community.  It integrates tightly
with the PPP daemon (pppd) to take advantage of all of the features of
that package.

The software has been tested on NetBSD 1.4.2 but should run on
any BSD variant that has pppd version 2.3.7 or later.  Note that
demand-dialing requires pppd 2.3.10 or later.
