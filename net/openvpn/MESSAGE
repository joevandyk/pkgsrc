The openvpn rc.d script looks for configuration files in:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}

and by default will start an openvpn process for each config file in
that directory.

The sample configuration files have been installed into:

	${PREFIX}/share/examples/openvpn/config

Please refer to the openvpn(8) manpage for full documentation on the
available options.

There is also a package for ``easy'' RSA key management installed into:

	${PREFIX}/share/openvpn/easy-rsa

that may optionally be used to set up a certificate authority for
generating SSL certificates for use with OpenVPN.  Please refer to the
README file in that directory for specific instructions.
