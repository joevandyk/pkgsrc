Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
server.  It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a
small network.  It can serve the names of local machines which are not
in the global DNS.  The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and
allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS
with names configured either in each host or in a central
configuration file.  Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases
and BOOTP for network booting of diskless machines.
