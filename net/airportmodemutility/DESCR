This is a small Java-based utility that monitors the connection state
of the modem of an Apple AirPort Base Station, sends signals to
connect or disconnect the modem on demand, and displays the
(approximate) length of time the modem has been connected. Version 2.0
also displays the modem connection speed when used with the new
("snow") version base stations.
