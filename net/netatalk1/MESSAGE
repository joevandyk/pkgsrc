To have Netatalk start automatically at boot, you will need to set the
following variables in /etc/rc.conf (replacing "YES" with "NO" for those
services you wish to not run):
		atalkd=YES
		afpd=YES
		papd=YES
		timelord=YES

Example Netatalk config files have been installed in the examples directory
at ${PREFIX}/share/examples/netatalk. Production config files are
installed in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}. If no config files existed before this
package was installed, default config files were copied in.
