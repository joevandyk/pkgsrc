This is the user process PPP package as found in FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
Normally, PPP is implemented as a part of the kernel (e.g., as managed by
pppd(8)) and it's thus somewhat hard to debug and/or modify its behaviour.
However, in this implementation PPP is done as a user process with the help
of the tunnel device driver (tun).
