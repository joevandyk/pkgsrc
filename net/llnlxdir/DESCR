LLNL XDIR manages files in a heterogeneous network.
It provides a graphical user interface for drag-and-drop
file transfer and for direct manipulation of local and
remote directories. LLNL XDIR has the ability to view
information in four different formats, including
hierarchical and iconic views. Based on UNIX, the C
programming language, OSF/Motif, and the file transfer
protocol FTP, LLNL XDIR is highly portable.
