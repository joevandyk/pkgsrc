The email package is a library for managing email messages,
including MIME and other RFC 2822-based message documents.  It is
intended to replace most of the functionality in several older
standard modules such as rfc822, mimetools, multifile, mimify, and
MIMEWriter, and other non-standard packages such as mimecntl.  It
is compliant with most of the email related RFCs such as 2045-2047
(the MIME RFCs) and 2231.

This version is identical to the package available in the Python
2.3 cvs development tree.  It is being made available as a
standalone distutils package for use in older Python releases.  A
minimum of Python 2.1 is required.
