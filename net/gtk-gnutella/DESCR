Gtk-Gnutella is a reliable and efficient Gnutella client, supporting the
latest Gnutella protocol, bandwidth limitation (both incoming and
outgoing) traffic compression, and advanced search filters among other
things.

Gnutella is a peer-based file-sharing protocol that allows a
user running a Gnutella client to search for and download files from
other Gnutella users, as well as share some files of their own.

Gtk-Gnutella offers all the extra features you expect from a modern
client: persistent downloads, searches and filters, intuitive interface,
upload statistics, and of course total control over many configuration
parameters.
