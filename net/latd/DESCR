The linux-decnet project (see http://linux-decnet.sourceforge.net/ )
is an effort to bring full DECnet support to Linux; however, they
also separately offer the latd package, a collection of programs
that speak Digital's old Local Area Terminal (LAT) protocol.  These
programs enable network clients to reach serial devices connected
to old LAT-only terminal servers, such as the DECserver 200/MC.

This is a redistribution of the linux-decnet project's software,
with NetBSD compatibility added.
