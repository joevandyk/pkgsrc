  BPALogin is a replacement for the Telstra supplied client for connecting
and using Telstra's Big Pond Advance powered by Cable.

  BPALogin has the following advantages over the standard Bigpond
LaunchPad client:

    * Does not crash like the standard one
    * Reconnects when there is a network problem
    * Is available for most operating systems, whereas BPA
      only support Windows and MacOS
    * Can run as a service on WinNT/2000
    * Comes with source code to allow endless customisation
