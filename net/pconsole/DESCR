This is pconsole, the parallel console tool. pconsole was meant as an
interactive administrative shell tool for clusters.

pconsole allows you to connect to each node of your cluster simultaneously,
and you can type your administrative commands in a specialized window that
'multiplies' the input to each of the connections you have opened.
pconsole is best run from within X Windows, although it is possible to
employ it without X (in console mode) as well.
You need to install pconsole on only 1 machine in the cluster, this would
usually be your central administrative node.
