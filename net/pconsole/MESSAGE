Note that the pconsole binary needs to be run as root. For security reasons
it was not installed suid root, thus you need to run pconsole.sh as root.

If you decide to make pconsole setuid root, mind to restrict access
via a special group (such as 'admin' or 'operator').

pconsole is a very powerful tool that should not fall into the wrong
hands. So, as root, execute:

	chown root:operator pconsole ; chmod 4110 pconsole

pconsole drops its root privileges when they're not needed, so the
program maintains maximum security.
