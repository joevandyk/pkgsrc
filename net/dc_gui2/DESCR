dc_gui2 is a GUI for DCTC (Direct Connect Text Client), another
file sharing protocol. Currently, it is still a beta version, some
features don't work but the most useful ones are available:

    * Currently, dc_gui can start a new client and/or attach itself
      to already running DCTC. You can also start several connections
      at the same time. You can switch between several DCTC.
    * search: mono-hub search works and takes into account all search
      criterias. It is already possible to start a download by clicking
      on the wanted file.
    * user list: the user list is simply displayed. It is already possible
      to retrieve user shared files list.
    * transfers: transfers are displayed and can be killed (either using
      the popup menu or using the 'd' key).
    * Preferences: current DCTC preferences are displayed and taken into
      account to start new client or to update running client.
