The Ocamlnet project provides a collection of modules for the
Objective Caml language which focus on application-level Internet
protocols and conventions.

The current distribution contains:

- a mature implementation of the CGI protocol
- an implementation of the JSERV protocol (AJP-1.2), can be used with
  mod_jserv (Apache JServ) and mod_jk (Jakarta connector) to connect
  application servers written in O'Caml with web servers
- a FastCGI implementation
- a POP3 client
- an SMTP client
- a library of string processing functions related to Internet
  protocols (formerly known as "netstring" and distributed separately):
  MIME encoding/decoding, Date/time parsing, Character encoding
  conversion, HTML parsing and printing, URL parsing and printing,
  OO-representation of channels, and a lot more.
- an experimental web server component
