Before using the netsaint-base package for the first time, you need to
set up the configuration files.  These can be copied from
${PREFIX}/share/examples/netsaint to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}
and then edited accordingly.

The documentation is installed in ${PREFIX}/share/netsaint/docs.

Please note that without additional "plug-in" testing programs this
package will not do anything very useful.  It is therefore recommended
you install the 'netsaint-plugins' package as well, and perhaps the
other 'netsaint-plugin-*' packages too.

Important Information About the Future of NetSaint
--------------------------------------------------
Date: 01-16-2002

For various reasons, I am planning on no longer using "NetSaint" as the
title of this software package.  Version 0.0.7 will be will be the last
release of this software package under the "NetSaint" name.
