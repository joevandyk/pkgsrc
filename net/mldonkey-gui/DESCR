mldonkey is a client to access the eDonkey network, a peer-to-peer network
particularly efficient for big files thanks to a multi-sources download
protocol.  It is written in Objective-Caml, and comes with its own GTK GUI,
an HTTP interface and a telnet interface.  It works on most UNIX platforms.

This package provides the GTK GUI interface, but not the core.  You will
have to install it (using the mldonkey package) in the same machine or
another one.
