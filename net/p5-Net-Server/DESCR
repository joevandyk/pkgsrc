"Net::Server" attempts to be a generic server as in "Net::Daemon" and
"NetServer::Generic". It includes with it the ability to run as an inetd
process ("Net::Server::INET"), a single connection server ("Net::Server"
or "Net::Server::Single"), a forking server ("Net::Server::Fork"), a
preforking server which maintains a constant number of preforked
children ("Net::Server::PreForkSimple"), or as a managed preforking
server which maintains the number of children based on server load
("Net::Server::PreFork"). In all but the inetd type, the server provides
the ability to connect to one or to multiple server ports.

"Net::Server" is built around a common class (Net::Server) and is
extended using sub classes, or "personalities". Each personality
inherits, overrides, or enhances the base methods of the base class.
