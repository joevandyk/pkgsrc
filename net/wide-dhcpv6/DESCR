WIDE-DHCPv6 is an open-source implementation of Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) developed by the KAME
project.

The implementation mainly conforms to the following standards:

- RFC3315: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
- RFC3319: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options
	   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers
- RFC3633: IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
	   Protocol (DHCP)
- RFC3646: DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host
	   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
- RFC4075: Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Configuration
	   Option for DHCPv6
- RFC4242: Information Refresh Time Option for Dynamic Host
	   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)

All the components of the main protocol are provided, i.e.,
DHCPv6 clients, servers, and relay agents.

Supported message types are as follows:
  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Release, Reply,
  Information-request, Relay-forward and Relay-reply.

Note that the current implementation does not support IPv6
temporary address allocation by DHCPv6, and there is no plan to
implement that feature at the moment.
