The scli package was written to address the need for small and efficient
command line utilities to monitor and configure network devices and
host systems. The scli package is based on the SNMP management
protocol.

To summarize, the slogan for this little package is:

  "After more than 10 years of SNMP, I felt it is time for really
   useful command line SNMP monitoring and configuration tools. ;-)"
