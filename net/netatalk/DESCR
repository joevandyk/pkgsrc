Netatalk is a freely-available, kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk
Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. A *NIX/*BSD system
running netatalk is capable of serving many macintosh clients simultaneously
as an AppleTalk router, AppleShare file server (AFP), *NIX/*BSD print server,
and for accessing AppleTalk printers via Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.
