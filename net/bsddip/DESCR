What is DIP?


DIP is mainly a tool to establish a SLIP connection.  It handles all
the necessary actions to set up the tty port and the modem, dial out
and finally build up a SLIP connection between the tty port and the
kernel.  To do so, dip offers an own very simple command language (a
mostly complete description can be found in the man page).

Dip can handle both incoming and outgoing connections using password
security for incoming connections.

For more details, have a look at the man page!
