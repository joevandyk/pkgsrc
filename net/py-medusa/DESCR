Medusa is a 'server platform' -- it provides a framework for
implementing asynchronous socket-based servers (TCP/IP and on Unix,
Unix domain, sockets).

An asynchronous socket server is a server that can communicate with
many other clients simultaneously by multiplexing I/O within a
single process/thread.  In the context of an HTTP server, this
means a single process can serve hundreds or even thousands of
clients, depending only on the operating system's configuration
and limitations.

Medusa includes HTTP, FTP, and 'monitor' (remote python interpreter)
servers.  Medusa can simultaneously support several instances of
either the same or different server types - for example you could
start up two HTTP servers, an FTP server, and a monitor server.
Then you could connect to the monitor server to control and manipulate
medusa while it is running.
