Oinkmaster is simple Perl script released under the BSD license to help you
update/manage your Snort 2.0+ rules and comment out the unwanted ones after
each update (among other things). It will tell you exactly what had changed
since the last update, hence giving you good control of your rules.
Oinkmaster can be used to manage the official rules from www.snort.org, but
can just as well be used for managing your homemade rules and distribute
them between sensors.
