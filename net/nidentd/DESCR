identd that does IPv6, IPv4 and NAT with IPv4.

NOTE: You should not rely on the data integrity the identd protocol
tries to provide you with. If you think you need this, you really need
protocols which do strong host and/or user authentication such as ssh
and IPsec in conjunction with audit trails.

Note also that this package is not very efficient in that it runs
several processes per connection.
