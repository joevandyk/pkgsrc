 Nicotine is a SoulSeek client written in Python, based on the
 PySoulSeek project by Alexander Kanavin. It features, among other
 things, a completely rewritten graphical user interface which uses
 PyGTK-2 toolkit and a less strict user request policy.

 Nicotine is a feature complete client for the SoulSeek filesharing
 network. You can use it to upload, download, search and chat. You
 can keep a "buddy" list and basically everything else a SoulSeek
 client is supposed to do. If you are familliar with PySoulSeek,
 you'll probably notice a striking resemblance in appearance. More
