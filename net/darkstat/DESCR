Effectively, it's a packet sniffer which runs as a background process
on a cable/DSL router, gathers all sorts of useless but interesting
statistics, and serves them over HTTP.

Features:
 * Traffic graphs.
 * Tracks traffic per host.
 * Tracks traffic per TCP and UDP port for each host.
 * Embedded web-server with deflate compression.
 * Asynchronous reverse DNS resolution using a child process.
 * Small. Portable. Single-threaded. Efficient.
