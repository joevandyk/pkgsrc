This little program polls network statistics and does a few things
with the data it gets.  It has small blinking lights for the rx and tx
of IP packets, a digital speedometer of your polled stat's current
speed and a bar graph like xload et. al which has a tx speed graph
from bottom-up and rx speed graph from the top-down.
