The Taylor UUCP package provides everything you need to make a UUCP
connection.  It currently supports the 'f', 'g' (in all window and
packet sizes), 'G', 't' and 'e' protocols, as well a Zmodem protocol,
the FX UUCICO 'y' protocol, and two new bidirectional protocols.
If you have a Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.
If you have TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  It supports
a new configuration file mechanism.
