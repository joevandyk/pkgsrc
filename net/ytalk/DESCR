YTalk is a compatible replacement for the Unix talk(1) program,
which adds a number of features.  Mainly, it can talk to more than
one person at a time, and it can talk to the two different types
of talk daemons out there.

YTalk supports multi-homed hosts, and provides a basic, optional
X interface.
