Stripes is a Looking Glass implementation that works with Zebra and
Cisco routers. A Looking Glass is a CGI script for viewing results of
simple queries executed on remote routers.

The queries and routers can be listed in a configuration file. This
allows for easy deployment on multiple machines without having to
modify the program itself. The configuration file is written in Perl,
so it has a lot of power for adapting to its environment.
