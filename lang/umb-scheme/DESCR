UMB Scheme is an implementation of the language described in the
"IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language" (December,
1990).

All syntax, variables and procedures are implemented.  Integers
are implemented as fixnums and bignums, rationals as pairs of
integers, (inexact) reals as double-precision floats, and (inexact)
complex numbers as pairs of double-precision floats.
