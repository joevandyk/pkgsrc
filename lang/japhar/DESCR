Japhar is the Hungry Programmers' Java VM.  It has been built from the
ground up without consulting Sun's sources.  It is currently at JDK
1.1.5-level.

Japhar is released under the LGPL, which should make it much more
attractive for companies interested in embedding an open source JVM in
their proprietary/commercial products.  For example, the LGPL is
compatible with Netscape's NPL license, and allows Japhar to be
included into Mozilla.
