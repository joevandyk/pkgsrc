BACI stands for Ben-Ari Concurrent Interpreter. The compiler and interpreter
originally were procedures in a program written by M. Ben-Ari, based on the
original Pascal compiler by Niklaus Wirth. The original version of the BACI
compiler and interpreter was created from that source code and was hosted on
a PRIME mainframe.  After several modifications and additions, this version
was ported to a PC version in Turbo Pascal, to Sun Pascal, and to C. Finally,
the compiler and interpreter were split into two separate programs.

Recently, a C-- compiler has been added to the BACI suite of programs to
compile source programs written in a restricted dialect of C++ into PCODE
object code executable by the interpreter. Compared with other concurrent
languages, BACI offers a variety of synchronization techniques with a
syntax that is usually familiar. Any experienced C or Pascal programmer could
use BACI within hours.
