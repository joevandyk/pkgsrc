SmallEiffel is intended to be a complete, though small and very fast,
free Eiffel compiler, and should run on any platform for which
an ANSI C - POSIX compiler exists.

The current distribution included an Eiffel to C compiler, an Eiffel
to Java bytecode compiler, a documentation tool, a pretty printer,
and various other tools.

Please note: version numbers are negative; -0.89, for example, is newer
than -0.91
