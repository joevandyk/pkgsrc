Expect is a program that performs programmed dialogue with other
interactive programs.  It is briefly described by its man page, expect(1).

It uses pseudo-tty's to control the child processes, so it is not affected
by programs that refuse to read from stdin or pipes. (eg: passwd(1) etc).

This package installs expectk, a version of the wish(1) interpreter for
tcl/tk with the expect extensions always present.
