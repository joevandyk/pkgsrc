INTERCAL. The language designed to be Turing-complete but as
fundamentally unlike any existing language as possible. Expressions
that look like line noise. Control constracts that will make you gasp,
make you laugh, and possibly make you hurl. Data structures? We don't
need no steenking data structures!

INTERCAL. Designed very early one May morning in 1972 by two hackers
who are still trying to live it down. Initially implemented on an IBM
360 running batch SPITBOL. Described by a manual that circulated for
years after the short life of the first implementation, reducing
strong men to tears (of laughter). Revived in 1990 by the C-INTERCAL
compiler, and now the center of an international community of
technomasochists.

INTERCAL. Now you, too, can be a part of the madness.
