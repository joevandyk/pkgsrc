SableVM is a portable bytecode interpreter written in C, and implementing
the Java virtual machine specification, second edition.  Its goals are to
be reasonably small, fast and efficient, as well as providing a well
designed and robust platform for conducting research.

SableVM implements many innovative techniques, including:
* 3 flavors of threaded interpretation (switched, threaded and inlined).
* Bidirectional object layout.
* Spinlock-free thin locks.
* Sparse interface vtables.
* Low-cost maps for precise garbage collection.
