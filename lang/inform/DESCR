Inform is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) game compiler -- it takes
source code you write and turns it into a game data file which is then
played using an 'interpreter'.  There are several interpreters available
which can play Inform games on different machines (e.g. frotz, jzip) -- you
can probably obtain one from the same place you got this package.

Inform is written by Graham Nelson <graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk>, and you
are free to redistribute it under certain conditions -- see the file
COPYING for details.
