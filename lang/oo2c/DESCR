In short, OOC is an Internet based project providing an Oberon-2
development platform. It consists of

  * an optimizing compiler,
  * a number of source code and compiler related tools,
  * a set of standard library modules, and
  * a reference manual.

oo2c is the first complete working compiler of the OOC project.
Instead of translating Oberon-2 modules to machine code, it generates
code for the most portable assembler in existence: ANSI-C. The
compiler was initially intended as a prototype backend for OOC, which
could then be used to evaluate and debug the frontend and the
optimization modules.  However, it is now a full-fledged development
system, and among other things, it is being used to develop native
code OOC backends.
