If you want to use WebSPL, you should add something like this
to your httpd.conf file:

        AddType application/x-httpd-webspl .webspl
        Action application/x-httpd-webspl /cgi-bin/webspl.cgi

You might also want to adjust permissions of libexec/cgi-bin/webspl_cache
to make sure only the web server has write permissions.
