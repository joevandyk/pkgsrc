1) You may want to adjust the "Optional languages"
   section of the Makefile before building this package.

2) The Ada compiler front-end of gcc is itself written
   in Ada. Consequently, an Ada compiler must be used
   to build this pkg. In pkgsrc, lang/gcc3-ada is version
   3.3 of the gcc Ada compiler; it also requires an Ada
   compiler to build. This pkg may also be built from
   lang/gcc34-ada.

   For bootstrapping, you can download a pre-built version
   of gcc 3.4.0 Ada from:

   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/ix86/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz
   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/pentium4/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz
   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/x86_64/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz

   The first two pkgs were built on NetBSD 2.0-BETA. The AMD64
   pkg was built under NetBSD 1.6ZL.
