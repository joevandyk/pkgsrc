OTcl, short for MIT Object Tcl, is an extension to Tcl/Tk for
object-oriented programming. It shouldn't be confused with the IXI
Object Tcl extension by Dean Sheenan.

   Some of OTcl's features as compared to alternatives are:
     * designed to be dynamically extensible, like Tcl, from the ground
       up
     * builds on Tcl syntax and concepts rather than importing another
       language
     * compact yet powerful object programming system (draws on CLOS,
       Smalltalk, and Self)
     * fairly portable implementation (2000 lines of C, without core
       hacks)
