ISO/Edinburgh-style Prolog compiler.  Compliant with Part 1 of the ISO
standard for Prolog.  Covers all traditional Edinburgh Prolog features
and shares many features with Quintus and SICStus Prolog, including a
compatible module system. Very fast compiler, garbage collection (also
on atoms), fast and powerful C/C++ interface, autoloading,
GNU-readline interface.  SWI-Prolog supports architectures with 32-bit
or greater (64-bit) word-length.

This is a meta-package that pulls in the interpreter and packages.
