Stalin is an aggressively optimizing whole-program compiler for Scheme
that does polyvariant interprocedural flow analysis, flow-directed
interprocedural escape analysis, flow-directed lightweight CPS
conversion, flow-directed lightweight closure conversion,
flow-directed interprocedural lifetime analysis, automatic in-lining,
unboxing, and flow-directed program-specific and
program-point-specific low-level representation selection and code
generation.

Stalin is now self hosting (ie. can compile itself).  The distributed
code is self-compiled.  Scheme->C is no longer used or needed to build
Stalin.

Stalin uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector and comes with a
foreign-procedure interface for Xlib and OpenGL, and a version of
QobiScheme, an extensive library of Scheme code.

Stalin is now released under the GNU Public License, version 2.
