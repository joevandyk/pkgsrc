This the MPD language for Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed
Programming.  Installation instructions are in the file doc/install.html.

Language documentation can be found at the MPD home on the web,
    http://www.cs.arizona.edu/mpd

MPD was inspired by the book:
    Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming
    Gregory R. Andrews
    Addison-Wesley, 2000  (ISBN 0-201-35752-6)

The MPD implementation is based on version 2.3.2 of the SR programming
language.  The syntax has changed, but the internals are essentially
the same except for a massive renaming.  Accordingly MPD is limited by
the features of SR and does not correspond exactly to the MPD book.

Much of the SR implementation documentation is still valid.  It can be
found at:
