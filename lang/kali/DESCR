Kali Scheme is a distributed implementation of Scheme that permits
efficient transmission of higher-order objects such as closures
and continuations. The integration of distributed communication
facilities within a higher-order programming language engenders a
number of new abstractions and paradigms for distributed computing.
Among these are user-specified load-balancing and migration policies
for threads, incrementally-linked distributed computations, and
parameterized client-server applications. Kali Scheme supports
concurrency and communication using first-class procedures and
continuations. It integrates procedures and continuations into a
message-based distributed framework that allows any Scheme object
(including code vectors) to be sent and received in a message. Some
of the applications and implementation techniques we have looked
at using Kali Scheme include:

	User-level load balancing and migration.
	Incremental distributed linking of code objects.
	Parameterized client-server applications.
	Long-lived parallel computations.
	Distributed data mining.
	Executable content in messages over wide-area networks
	(e.g. the World-Wide Web)
