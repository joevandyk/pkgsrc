JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification
version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial)
it is extremely small, with a stripped executable on PowerPC of only ~135K,
and Intel 100K. However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to
support the full specification, and includes support for object finalisation,
the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
