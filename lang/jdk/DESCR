This is a package of Sun's Java Development Kit, done by Simon Gerraty
and others, and is in turn based upon the FreeBSD port.

The Java Development Kit is a development environment for writing
applets and applications that conform to the Java Core API.
Its compiler and other tools are run from a shell and have no GUI
interface.
