Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed
for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including
system administration, web development, network programming, GUI
development, and more.  The language is intended to be practical (easy
to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).  Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both
procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in
support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive
collections of third-party modules.
