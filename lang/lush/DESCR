Lush is an object-oriented Lisp interpreter/compiler with features
designed to please people who want to prototype large numerical
applications. Lush includes an extensive library of
vector/matrix/tensor manipulation, numerous numerical libraries
(including GSL, LAPACK, and BLAS), a set of graphic functions, a
simple GUI toolkit, and interfaces to various graphic and multimedia
libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Video4Linux, and ALSA (video/audio
grabbing), and others. Lush is an ideal frontend script language for
programming projects written in C or other languages.  Lush also has
libraries for Machine Learning, Neural Nets and statistical estimation
(which are the main interests of the authors).
