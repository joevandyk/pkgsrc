It is intended to be a complete, though small and very fast, free Eiffel
compiler. It is available for a very wide range of platforms: GNU/Linux,
GNU/Hurd, FreeBSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, XENIX, Solaris,
DOS, OS2, WINDOWS NT/95/2000, Macintosh, NeXT, Amiga, AmigaDE/Elate, BeOS,
QNX, VMS, etc. Actually, SmartEiffel should run on any platform for which
an ANSI C compiler exists.

The current distribution includes an Eiffel to C compiler, an Eiffel to
Java bytecode compiler, a debugger, a documentation tool, a pretty printer
and various other tools.
