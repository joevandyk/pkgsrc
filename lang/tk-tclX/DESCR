Extended Tcl (TclX), is a set of extensions to Tcl, the Tool Command
Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout.  Tcl is a powerful, yet simple
embeddable programming language.  Extended Tcl is oriented towards system
programming tasks and large application development.  TclX provides additional
interfaces to the operating system, and adds many new programming constructs,
text manipulation tools, and debugging tools.
