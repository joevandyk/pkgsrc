The Jikes project is a collaborative software development project
dedicated to providing a compiler from Java source code to bytecode
that is conformant, robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, and
freely available.  This project is jointly managed by a group of
companies and individual volunteers throughout the world, using the
Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the compiler
and its related software and documentation.

The Jikes project is licensed under the IBM Public License, which has
been approved by the Open Source Initiative.

The project currently includes the Jikes compiler, the Jikes Parser
Generator, and the Jikes Test Suite.
