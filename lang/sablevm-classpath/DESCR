SableVM is a portable bytecode interpreter written in C, and implementing
the Java virtual machine specification, second edition.  Its goals are to
be reasonably small, fast and efficient, as well as providing a well
designed and robust platform for conducting research.

This package contains the class library for SableVM, based on GNU classpath.
