CryptoFS is a encrypted file system for File system in Userspace (FUSE).

CryptoFS will use a normal directory to store files encrypted. The
mount point will contain the decrypted files. Every file stored in
this mount point will be written encrypted (data and filename) to the
directory that was mounted. If you unmount the directory the encrypted
data can only be access by mounting the directory with the correct key
again.
