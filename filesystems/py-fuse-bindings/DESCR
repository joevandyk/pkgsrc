Python bindings for the FUSE and refuse interfaces.

FUSE allows file sytsem operations to take place at user level, rather
than in the kernel.  Refuse is a BSD-licensed re-implementation of
fuse, running on top of the puffs functionality.  This package
provides a python language interface to the FUSE interface.

To achieve backwards compatibility with previous versions of the fuse
bindings for python, set the environment variable

	FUSE_PYTHON_COMPAT=0.1
