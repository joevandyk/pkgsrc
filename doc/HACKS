hack	perl5-base
mdate	12 Apr 2001
who	manu
port	all
Checking in perl5-base/patches/patch-ag: 1.2 : 1 : 999
descr
	The Xerces-Perl module is implemented as a shared object. It needs
	some symbols from libgcc.a, such as __eh_alloc. It's not possible
	to link the xerces-P shared object with libgcc.a, because libgcc.a
	is not compiled with -fPIC. Hence we need to have the missing
	symbols in the Perl executable.
	This hack includes the whole libgcc.a in the Perl executable, and
	links with c++ so that some mandatory symbols such as __pure_virtual
	are also included. It should go away with GCC-3.0, or if we make a
	libgcc.so on day.

cdate 	26 Feb 2002
who	mrauch
file	misc/openoffice/patches/patch-dj
file	misc/openoffice/patches/patch-dk
descr	Using versioned symbols the special symbol _etext can end up
	in the shared library with a junk value for the version string
	instead of "0" for no version. Sometimes it is sufficient to
	reorder the -l flags on the link line but the general hack is to
	disable versioned symbols.

hack	libtool nawk line length problem
cdate	Tue Sep  7 01:23:10 UTC 2004
who	jschauma
port	mipseb (IRIX)
file	x11/gtk2/Makefile
descr
	If we're on IRIX and we're using gcc, then, apparently, we need gawk,
	as otherwise the awk invocation in libtool breaks complaining about
	the ``Input record [...] too long'' near the end of the build process.
	Oddly this does not occur using the mipspro compiler.  Possible
	reason: using gcc we have longer CFLAGS.  Fix:  add USE_GNU_TOOLS+=awk
	iff IRIX and gcc.  Problem: this might affect other packages as well.
	One might consider depending libtool on gawk for IRIX.

hack	security/libgpg-error awk on IRIX
cdate	Sun May 15 18:08:48 EDT 2005
who	jschauma
port	mipseb (IRIX)
file	security/libgpg-error/Makefile
descr
	Apparently, for as of yet undetermined reasons, gawk as built on IRIX
	under pkgsrc croaks on regular expressions including a combination of
	alpha- and numerical matches, such as the rather trivial
	/^[ \t]*[0-9]+/
	Let's use the system's AWK (ie nawk) for this package to avoid
	breaking hundreds of dependents.
	Speculation: somehow the regular expression library used to build gawk
	conflicts with the systems regular expression library or some such.
	Note: gawk from SGIs freeware collection depends on expat -- why is
	that?  Does that have anything to do with anything?
