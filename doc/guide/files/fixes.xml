    <title>Portability of packages</title>

    <para>One appealing feature of pkgsrc is that it runs on many
    different platforms. As a result, it is important to ensure,
    where possible, that packages in pkgsrc are portable. This
    chapter mentions some particular details you should pay
    attention to while working on pkgsrc.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="pulling-vars-from-etc-mk.conf">
    <title>How to pull in user-settable variables from &mk.conf;</title>

    <para>The pkgsrc user can configure pkgsrc by overriding several
    variables in the file pointed to by <varname>MAKECONF</varname>,
    which is &mk.conf; by default. When you
    want to use those variables in the preprocessor directives of
    &man.make.1; (for example <literal>.if</literal> or
    <literal>.for</literal>), you need to include the file
    <filename>../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk</filename> before, which in turn
    loads the user preferences.</para>

    <para>But note that some variables may not be completely defined
    after <filename>../../mk/bsd.prefs.mk</filename> has been
    included, as they may contain references to variables that are
    not yet defined. In shell commands this is no problem, since
    variables are actually macros, which are only expanded when they
    are used. But in the preprocessor directives mentioned above and
    in dependency lines (of the form <literal>target:
    dependencies</literal>) the variables are expanded at load
    time.</para>

    <note><para>Currently there is no exhaustive list of all
    variables that tells you whether they can be used at load time
    or only at run time, but it is in preparation.</para></note>

  <sect2 id="user-interaction">
    <title>User interaction</title>

    <para>Occasionally, packages require interaction from the user,
    and this can be in a number of ways:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
	<para>When fetching the distfiles, some packages require user
	interaction such as entering username/password or accepting a
	license on a web page.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>When extracting the distfiles, some packages may ask for
	passwords.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>help to configure the package before it is built</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>help during the build process</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>help during the installation of a package</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <varname>INTERACTIVE_STAGE</varname> definition is
    provided to notify the pkgsrc mechanism of an interactive stage
    which will be needed, and this should be set in the package's
    <filename>Makefile</filename>, e.g.:</para>

    <programlisting>
INTERACTIVE_STAGE=      build
    </programlisting>

    <para>Multiple interactive stages can be specified:</para>

    <programlisting>
INTERACTIVE_STAGE=      configure install
    </programlisting>

    <para>The user can then decide to skip this package by setting the
    <varname>BATCH</varname> variable.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="handling-licenses">
    <title>Handling licenses</title>

    <para>Authors of software can choose the licence under which
    software can be copied.  This is due to copyright law, and reasons
    for license choices are outside the scope of pkgsrc.  The pkgsrc
    system recognizes that there are a number of licenses which some
    users may find objectionable or difficult or impossible to comply
    with.  The Free Software Foundation has declared some licenses
    "Free", and the Open Source Initiative has a definition of "Open
    Source".  The pkgsrc system, as a policy choice, does not label
    packages which have licenses that are Free or Open Source.
    However, packages without a license meeting either of those tests
    are labeled with a license tag denoting the license.  Note that a
    package with no license to copy trivially does not meet either the
    Free or Open Source test.</para>

    <para>For packages which are not Free or Open Source, pkgsrc will
    not build the package unless the user has indicated to pkgsrc that
    packages with that particular license may be built.  Note that
    this documentation avoids the term "accepted the license".  The
    pkgsrc system is merely providing a mechanism to avoid
    accidentally building a package with a non-free license;
    judgement and responsibility remain with the user.  (Installation
    of binary packages are not currently subject to this mechanism;
    this is a bug.)</para>

    <para>One might want to only install packages with a BSD license,
    or the GPL, and not the other.  The pkgsrc license tag mechanism
    does not provide a way to do this.  It might be possible to put in
    tags for free licenses, and have a default
    <varname>ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES</varname> variable value, but this is
    widely viewed as having a very poor ratio of benefit to
    work.</para>

    <para>The license tag mechanism is intended to address
    copyright-related issues surrounding building, installing and
    using a package, and not to address redistribution issues (see
    <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> and
    <varname>NO_SRC_ON_FTP</varname>, etc.).  However, the above
    definition of licenses for which tags are not needed implies
    that packages with redistribution restrictions should have
    tags, because Free or Open Source programs do not have
    redistribution restrictions.</para>

    <para>Denoting that a package may be copied according to a
    particular license is done by placing the license in
    <filename>pkgsrc/licenses</filename> and setting the
    <varname>LICENSE</varname> variable to a string identifying the
    license, e.g. in <filename
    role="pkg">graphics/xv</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>
LICENSE=        xv-license
    </programlisting>

    <para>When trying to build, the user will get a notice that the
    package is covered by a license which has not been placed in the
    <varname>ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES</varname> variable:</para>

    <programlisting>
&cprompt; <userinput>make</userinput>
===> xv-3.10anb9 has an unacceptable license: xv-license.
===>     To view the license, enter "/usr/bin/make show-license".
===>     To indicate acceptance, add this line to your /etc/mk.conf:
===>     ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES+=xv-license
*** Error code 1
    </programlisting>

    <para>The license can be viewed with <command>make
    show-license</command>, and if the user so chooses, the line
    printed above can be added to &mk.conf; to
    convey to pkgsrc that it should not in the future fail because of
    that license:</para>

    <programlisting>
ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES+=xv-license
    </programlisting>

    <para>When adding a package with a new license, the license text
    should be added to <filename>pkgsrc/licenses</filename> for
    displaying.  A list of known licenses can be seen in this
    directory.</para>

    <para>When the license changes (in a way other than formatting),
    please make sure that the new license has a different name (e.g.,
    append the version number if it exists, or the date).  Just
    because a user told pkgsrc to build programs under a previous
    version of a license does not mean that pkgsrc should build
    programs under the new licenses.  The higher-level point is that
    pkgsrc does not evaluate licenses for reasonableness; the only
    test is a mechanistic test of whether a particular text has been
    approved by either of two bodies.</para>

    <para>The use of <varname>LICENSE=shareware</varname>,
    <varname>LICENSE=no-commercial-use</varname>, and similar language
    is deprecated because it does not crisply refer to a particular
    license text.  Another problem with such usage is that it does not
    enable a user to tell pkgsrc to proceed for a single package
    without also telling pkgsrc to proceed for all packages with that
    tag.</para> </sect2>

  <sect2 id="restricted-packages">
    <title>Restricted packages</title>

    <para>Some licenses restrict how software may be re-distributed.
    Because a license tag is required unless the package is Free or
    Open Source, all packages with restrictions should have license
    tags.  By declaring the restrictions, package tools can
    automatically refrain from e.g. placing binary packages on FTP
    sites.</para>

    <para>There are four restrictions that may be encoded, which are
    the cross product of sources (distfiles) and binaries not being
    placed on FTP sites and CD-ROMs.  Because this is rarely the exact
    language in any license, and because non-Free licenses tend to be
    different from each other, pkgsrc adopts a definition of FTP and
    CD-ROM.  Pkgsrc uses "FTP" to mean that the source or binary file
    should not be made available over the Internet at no charge.
    Pkgsrc uses "CD-ROM" to mean that the source or binary may not be
    made available on some kind of media, together with other source
    and binary packages, and which is sold for a distribution charge.
    </para>

    <para>In order to encode these restrictions, the package system
    defines five make variables that can be set to note these
    restrictions:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><varname>RESTRICTED</varname></para>

	<para>This variable should be set whenever a restriction
	exists (regardless of its kind).  Set this variable to a
	string containing the reason for the restriction.  It should
	be understood that those wanting to understand the restriction
	will have to read the license, and perhaps seek advice of
	counsel.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>NO_BIN_ON_CDROM</varname></para>

	<para>Binaries may not be placed on CD-ROM containing other
	binary packages, for which a distribution charge may be made.
	In this case, set this variable to
	<varname>${RESTRICTED}</varname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>NO_BIN_ON_FTP</varname></para>

	<para>Binaries may not made available on the Internet without
	charge.  In this case, set this variable to
	<varname>${RESTRICTED}</varname>.  If this variable is set,
	binary packages will not be included on ftp.NetBSD.org.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>NO_SRC_ON_CDROM</varname></para>

	<para>Distfiles may not be placed on CD-ROM, together with
	other distfiles, for which a fee may be charged.  In this
	case, set this variable to <varname>${RESTRICTED}</varname>.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><varname>NO_SRC_ON_FTP</varname></para>

	<para>Distfiles may not made available via FTP at no charge.
	In this case, set this variable to
	<varname>${RESTRICTED}</varname>.  If this variable is set,
	the distfile(s) will not be mirrored on ftp.NetBSD.org.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Please note that the use of <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>,
    <varname>IGNORE</varname>, <varname>NO_CDROM</varname>, or other
    generic make variables to denote restrictions is deprecated,
    because they unconditionally prevent users from generating
    binary packages!</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2 id="dependencies">
    <title>Handling dependencies</title>

    <para>Your package may depend on some other package being present
    - and there are various ways of expressing this dependency.
    pkgsrc supports the <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> and
    <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definitions, the
    <varname>USE_TOOLS</varname> definition, as well as dependencies
    via <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>, which is the preferred way
    to handle dependencies, and which uses the variables named above.
    See <xref linkend="buildlink"/> for more information.</para>

    <para>The basic difference between the two variables is as
    follows: The <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition registers
    that pre-requisite in the binary package so it will be pulled in
    when the binary package is later installed, whilst the
    <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> definition does not, marking a
    dependency that is only needed for building the package.</para>

    <para>This means that if you only need a package present whilst
    you are building, it should be noted as a
    <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.</para>

    <para>The format for a <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> and a
    <varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition is:</para>

    <programlisting>
&lt;pre-req-package-name&gt;:../../&lt;category&gt;/&lt;pre-req-package&gt;
    </programlisting>

    <para>Please note that the <quote>pre-req-package-name</quote>
    may include any of the wildcard version numbers recognized by
    &man.pkg.info.1;.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>If your package needs another package's binaries or
	libraries to build or run, and if that package has a
	<filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file available, use it:</para>

	<programlisting>
.include "../../graphics/jpeg/buildlink3.mk"
	</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If your package needs to use another package to build
	itself and there is no <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename>
	file available, use the <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>
	definition:</para>

	<programlisting>
BUILD_DEPENDS+= autoconf-2.13:../../devel/autoconf
	</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

	<para>If your package needs a library with which to link and
	again there is no <filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file
	available, this is specified using the
	<varname>DEPENDS</varname> definition. For example:</para>

	<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=       xpm-3.4j:../../graphics/xpm
	</programlisting>

	<para>You can also use wildcards in package dependencies:</para>

	<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=       xpm-[0-9]*:../../graphics/xpm
	</programlisting>

	<para>Note that such wildcard dependencies are retained when
	creating binary packages.  The dependency is checked when
	installing the binary package and any package which matches
	the pattern will be used.  Wildcard dependencies should be
	used with care.</para>

	<para>The <quote>-[0-9]*</quote> should be used instead of
	<quote>-*</quote> to avoid potentially ambiguous matches
	such as <quote>tk-postgresql</quote> matching a
	<quote>tk-*</quote> <varname>DEPENDS</varname>.</para>

	<para>Wildcards can also be used to specify that a package
	will only build against a certain minimum version of a
	pre-requisite:</para>

	<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=       tiff>=3.5.4:../../graphics/tiff
	</programlisting>

	<para>This means that the package will build against version
	3.5.4 of the tiff library or newer.  Such a dependency may
	be warranted if, for example, the API of the library has
	changed with version 3.5.4 and a package would not compile
	against an earlier version of tiff.</para>

	<para>Please note that such dependencies should only be
	updated if a package requires a newer pre-requisite, but
	not to denote recommendations such as
	ABI changes that do not prevent a package from building
	correctly.  Such recommendations can be expressed using
	<varname>ABI_DEPENDS</varname>:</para>

	<programlisting>
ABI_DEPENDS+=   tiff>=3.6.1:../../graphics/tiff
	</programlisting>

	<para>In addition to the above <varname>DEPENDS</varname>
	line, this denotes that while a package will build against
	tiff&gt;=3.5.4, at least version 3.6.1 is recommended.
	<varname>ABI_DEPENDS</varname> entries will be turned into
	dependencies unless explicitly ignored (in which case a
	warning will be printed).</para>

	<para>To ignore these ABI dependency recommendations and just
	use the required <varname>DEPENDS</varname>, set
	<varname>USE_ABI_DEPENDS=NO</varname>.   This may make
	it easier and faster to update packages built using pkgsrc,
	since older compatible dependencies can continue to be
	used. This is useful for people who watch their rebuilds
	very carefully; it is not very good as a general-purpose
	hammer.  If you use it, you need to be mindful of possible
	ABI changes, including those from the underlying OS.</para>

	<para>Packages that are built with recommendations ignored
	may not be uploaded to ftp.NetBSD.org by developers and
	should not be used across different systems that may have
	different versions of binary packages installed.</para>

	<para>For security fixes, please update the package
	vulnerabilities file. See <xref
	linkend="security-handling"/> for more
	information.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If your package needs some executable to be able to run
	correctly and if there's no
	<filename>buildlink3.mk</filename> file, this is specified
	using the <varname>DEPENDS</varname> variable. The
	<filename role="pkg">print/lyx</filename> package needs to
	be able to execute the latex binary from the teTeX package
	when it runs, and that is specified:</para>

	<programlisting>
DEPENDS+=        teTeX-[0-9]*:../../print/teTeX
	</programlisting>

	<para>The comment about wildcard dependencies from previous
	paragraph applies here, too.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If your package needs files from another package to build,
    add the relevant distribution files to
    <varname>DISTFILES</varname>, so they will be extracted
    automatically. See the <filename
    role="pkg">print/ghostscript</filename> package for an example.
    (It relies on the jpeg sources being present in source form
    during the build.)</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2 id="conflicts">
    <title>Handling conflicts with other packages</title>

    <para>Your package may conflict with other packages a user might
    already have installed on his system, e.g. if your package
    installs the same set of files as another package in the pkgsrc
    tree.</para>

    <para>In this case you can set <varname>CONFLICTS</varname> to a
    space-separated list of packages (including version string) your
    package conflicts with.</para>

    <para>For example, <filename role="pkg">x11/Xaw3d</filename>
    and <filename role="pkg">x11/Xaw-Xpm</filename>
    install the same shared library, thus you set in
    <filename>pkgsrc/x11/Xaw3d/Makefile</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>
CONFLICTS=      Xaw-Xpm-[0-9]*
    </programlisting>

    <para>and in <filename>pkgsrc/x11/Xaw-Xpm/Makefile</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>
CONFLICTS=      Xaw3d-[0-9]*
    </programlisting>

    <para>Packages will automatically conflict with other packages
    with the name prefix and a different version
    string. <quote>Xaw3d-1.5</quote> e.g. will automatically
    conflict with the older version <quote>Xaw3d-1.3</quote>.</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2 id="not-building-packages">
    <title>Packages that cannot or should not be built</title>

    <para>There are several reasons why a package might be
    instructed to not build under certain circumstances.  If the
    package builds and runs on most platforms, the exceptions
    should be noted with <varname>NOT_FOR_PLATFORM</varname>.  If
    the package builds and runs on a small handful of platforms,
    set <varname>ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM</varname> instead.
    Both <varname>ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM</varname> and
    <varname>NOT_FOR_PLATFORM</varname> are OS triples
    (OS-version-platform) that can use glob-style
    wildcards.</para>
    <para>Some packages are tightly bound to a specific version of an
    operating system, e.g. LKMs or <filename
    role="pkg">sysutils/lsof</filename>.  Such binary packages are not
    backwards compatible with other versions of the OS, and should be
    uploaded to a version specific directory on the FTP server.  Mark
    these packages by setting <varname>OSVERSION_SPECIFIC</varname> to
    <quote>yes</quote>.  This variable is not currently used by any of
    the package system internals, but may be used in the
    future.</para>
    <para>If the package should be skipped (for example, because it
    provides functionality already provided by the system), set
    <varname>PKG_SKIP_REASON</varname> to a descriptive message.  If
    the package should fail because some preconditions are not met,
    set <varname>PKG_FAIL_REASON</varname> to a descriptive
    message.</para>

  <sect2 id="undeletable-packages">
    <title>Packages which should not be deleted, once installed</title>

    <para>To ensure that a package may not be deleted, once it has been
    installed, the <varname>PKG_PRESERVE</varname> definition should
    be set in the package Makefile. This will be carried into any
    binary package that is made from this pkgsrc entry. A

  <sect2 id="bumping-pkgrevision">
    <title>How to handle incrementing versions when fixing an existing package</title>

    <para>When making fixes to an existing package it can be useful
    to change the version number in <varname>PKGNAME</varname>. To
    avoid conflicting with future versions by the original author, a
    <quote>nb1</quote>, <quote>nb2</quote>, ... suffix can be used
    on package versions by setting <varname>PKGREVISION=1</varname>
    (2, ...). The <quote>nb</quote> is treated like a
    <quote>.</quote> by the package tools. e.g.</para>

    <programlisting>
DISTNAME=       foo-17.42
PKGREVISION=    9
    </programlisting>

    <para>will result in a <varname>PKGNAME</varname> of
    <quote>foo-17.42nb9</quote>. If you want to use the original
    value of <varname>PKGNAME</varname> without the <quote>nbX</quote>
    suffix, e.g. for setting <varname>DIST_SUBDIR</varname>, use
    <varname>PKGNAME_NOREV</varname>.</para>

    <para>When a new release of the package is released, the
    <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> should be removed, e.g. on a new

    <programlisting>
DISTNAME=       foo-17.43

    <para><varname>PKGREVISION</varname> should be incremented for any
    non-trivial change in the resulting binary package.  Without a
    <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> bump, someone with the previous
    version installed has no way of knowing that their package is out
    of date.  Thus, changes without increasing
    <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> are essentially labeled "this is so
    trivial that no reasonable person would want to upgrade", and this
    is the rough test for when increasing
    <varname>PKGREVISION</varname> is appropriate.  Examples of

    This is where the SUBST framework comes in. It provides an
    easy-to-use interface for replacing text in files.
    Example:</para>

    <programlisting>
SUBST_CLASSES+=                 fix-paths
SUBST_STAGE.fix-paths=          pre-configure
SUBST_MESSAGE.fix-paths=        Fixing absolute paths.
SUBST_FILES.fix-paths=          src/*.c
SUBST_FILES.fix-paths+=         scripts/*.sh
SUBST_SED.fix-paths=            -e 's,"/usr/local,"${PREFIX},g'
SUBST_SED.fix-paths+=           -e 's,"/var/log,"${VARBASE}/log,g'
    </programlisting>

    <para><varname>SUBST_CLASSES</varname> is a list of identifiers
    that are used to identify the different SUBST blocks that are
    defined. The SUBST framework is heavily used by pkgsrc, so it is
    important to always use the <literal>+=</literal> operator with
    this variable. Otherwise some substitutions may be
    skipped.</para>

    <para>The remaining variables of each SUBST block are
    parameterized with the identifier from the first line
    (<literal>fix-paths</literal> in this case.) They can be seen as
    parameters to a function call.</para>

    <para><varname>SUBST_STAGE.*</varname> specifies the stage at
    which the replacement will take place. All combinations of
    <literal>pre-</literal>, <literal>do-</literal> and
    <literal>post-</literal> together with a phase name are
    possible, though only few are actually used. Most commonly used
    are <literal>post-patch</literal> and
    <literal>pre-configure</literal>. Of these two,
    <literal>pre-configure</literal> should be preferred because
    then it is possible to run <command>bmake patch</command> and
    have the state after applying the patches but before making any
    other changes. This is especially useful when you are debugging
    a package in order to create new patches for it. Similarly,
    <literal>post-build</literal> is preferred over
    <literal>pre-install</literal>, because the install phase should
    generally be kept as simple as possible. When you use
    <literal>post-build</literal>, you have the same files in the
    working directory that will be installed later, so you can check
    if the substitution has succeeded.</para>

    <para><varname>SUBST_MESSAGE.*</varname> is an optional text
    that is printed just before the substitution is done.</para>

    <para><varname>SUBST_FILES.*</varname> is the list of shell
    globbing patterns that specifies the files in which the
    substitution will take place. The patterns are interpreted
    relatively to the <varname>WRKSRC</varname> directory.</para>

    <para><varname>SUBST_SED.*</varname> is a list of arguments to
    &man.sed.1; that specify the actual substitution. Every sed
    command should be prefixed with <literal>-e</literal>, so that
    all SUBST blocks look uniform.</para>

    <para>There are some more variables, but they are so seldomly
    used that they are only documented in the
    <filename>mk/subst.mk</filename> file.</para>

  <sect2 id="modified-distfiles-same-name">
    <title>How to handle modified distfiles with the 'old' name</title>

    <para>Sometimes authors of a software package make some
    modifications after the software was released, and they put up a
    new distfile without changing the package's version number. If a
    package is already in pkgsrc at that time, the checksum will
    no longer match. The contents of the new distfile should be
    compared against the old one before changing anything, to make
    sure the distfile was really updated on purpose, and that
    no trojan horse or so crept in.
    Please mention that the distfiles were compared and what was found
    in your commit message.
    Then, the correct way to work around this is to
    set <varname>DIST_SUBDIR</varname> to a unique directory name,
    usually based on <varname>PKGNAME_NOREV</varname>. All
    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
    <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> for this package will be put in that
    subdirectory of the local distfiles directory.
    (See <xref linkend="bumping-pkgrevision"/> for more details.)
    In case this
    happens more often, <varname>PKGNAME</varname> can be used (thus
    including the <filename>nbX</filename> suffix) or a date stamp
    can be appended, like <varname>${PKGNAME_NOREV}-YYYYMMDD</varname>.
    Do not forget regenerating the <filename>distinfo</filename> file
    after that, since it contains the <varname>DIST_SUBDIR</varname>
    path in the filenames.
    Also increase the PKGREVISION if the installed package is different.
    Furthermore, a mail to the package's authors seems appropriate
    telling them that changing distfiles after releases without
    changing the file names is not good practice.</para>

    <title>Shared libraries - libtool</title>

    <para>pkgsrc supports many different machines, with different
    object formats like a.out and ELF, and varying abilities to do
    shared library and dynamic loading at all. To accompany this,
    varying commands and options have to be passed to the
    compiler, linker, etc. to get the Right Thing, which can be
    pretty annoying especially if you don't have all the machines
    at your hand to test things.  The
    <filename role="pkg">devel/libtool</filename> pkg
    can help here, as it just <quote>knows</quote> how to build
    both static and dynamic libraries from a set of source files,
    thus being platform-independent.</para>

    <para>Here's how to use libtool in a package in seven simple
    steps:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Add <varname>USE_LIBTOOL=yes</varname> to the package
	Makefile.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>For library objects, use <quote>${LIBTOOL} --mode=compile
	${CC}</quote> in place of <quote>${CC}</quote>. You could even
	add it to the definition of <varname>CC</varname>, if only
	libraries are being built in a given Makefile. This one command
	will build both PIC and non-PIC library objects, so you need not
	have separate shared and non-shared library rules.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>For the linking of the library, remove any
	<quote>ar</quote>, <quote>ranlib</quote>, and <quote>ld
	-Bshareable</quote> commands, and instead use:</para>

	<programlisting>
${LIBTOOL} --mode=link \
    ${CC} -o ${.TARGET:.a=.la} \
        ${OBJS:.o=.lo} \
        -rpath ${PREFIX}/lib \
        -version-info major:minor
	</programlisting>

	<para>Note that the library is changed to have a
	<filename>.la</filename> extension, and the objects are
	changed to have a <filename>.lo</filename>
	extension. Change <varname>OBJS</varname> as
	necessary. This automatically creates all of the
	<filename>.a</filename>,
	<filename>.so.major.minor</filename>, and ELF symlinks (if
	necessary) in the build directory. Be sure to include
	<quote>-version-info</quote>, especially when major and
	minor are zero, as libtool will otherwise strip off the
	shared library version.</para>

	<para>From the libtool manual:</para>

	<programlisting>
So, libtool library versions are described by three integers:

CURRENT
The most recent interface number that this library implements.

REVISION
The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

AGE
The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that
this library implements.  In other words, the library implements
all the interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT -
AGE' to `CURRENT'.

If two libraries have identical CURRENT and AGE numbers, then the
dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater REVISION number.
	</programlisting>

	<para>The <quote>-release</quote> option will produce
	different results for a.out and ELF (excluding symlinks)
	in only one case. An ELF library of the form
	<quote>libfoo-release.so.<emphasis>x</emphasis>.<emphasis>y</emphasis></quote>
	will have a symlink of
	<quote>libfoo.so.<emphasis>x</emphasis>.<emphasis>y</emphasis></quote>
	on an a.out platform. This is handled
	automatically.</para>

	<para>The <quote>-rpath argument</quote> is the install
	directory of the library being built.</para>

	<para>In the <filename>PLIST</filename>, include only the
	<filename>.la</filename> file, the other files will be

possibility. That compiler cannot handle the following code:</para>

<programlisting>
extern int extern_func(int);

static inline int
inline_func(int x)
{
        return extern_func(x);
}

int main(void)
{
        return 0;
}
</programlisting>

<para>It generates the code for <function>inline_func</function> even if
that function is never used. This code then refers to
<function>extern_func</function>, which can usually not be resolved. To
solve this problem you can try to tell the package to disable inlining
of functions.</para>

  <sect2 id="out-of-memory">
    <title>Running out of memory</title>

    <para>Sometimes packages fail to build because the compiler runs
    into an operating system specific soft limit.  With the
    <varname>UNLIMIT_RESOURCES</varname> variable pkgsrc can be told
    to unlimit the resources.  Currently, the allowed values are
    <quote>datasize</quote> and <quote>stacksize</quote> (or both).
    Setting this variable is similar to running the shell builtin
    <command>ulimit</command> command to raise the maximum data
    segment size or maximum stack size of a process, respectively, to
    their hard limits.</para>

    <filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGNAME}</filename> (the latter
    includes the version number of the package).</para>

    <para>Many modern packages using GNU autoconf allow to set the
    directory where HTML documentation is installed with the

    is needed because otherwise the documentation ends up in
    <filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/html</filename> or other
    places.</para>

    <para>An exception to the above is that library API documentation
    generated with the <filename
    role="pkg">textproc/gtk-doc</filename> tools, for use by special
    browsers (devhelp) should be left at their default location, which
    is <filename>${PREFIX}/share/gtk-doc</filename>.  Such
    documentation can be recognized from files ending in
    <filename>.devhelp</filename> or <filename>.devhelp2</filename>.
    (It is also acceptable to install such files in
    <filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGBASE}</filename> or
    <filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/${PKGNAME}</filename>; the
    <filename>.devhelp*</filename> file must be directly in that
    directory then, no additional subdirectory level is allowed in
    this case. This is usually achieved by using
    <quote>--with-html-dir=${PREFIX}/share/doc</quote>.
    <filename>${PREFIX}/share/gtk-doc</filename> is preferred
    though.)</para>

    <para>Certain packages, most of them in the games category, install

    installed setgid and the score files owned by the appropriate

    <para>Note that per default, setgid installation of games is
    disabled;  setting <varname>SETGIDGAME=YES</varname> will set all

    <para>Perl5 modules will install into different places depending

    the package Makefile so that <filename>INSTALL</filename> and
    <filename>DEINSTALL</filename> scripts will be generated to
    handle registration of the info files in the Info directory
    file. The <quote>install-info</quote> command used for the info

    special purpose package automatically added as dependency if
    needed.</para>

    <para><varname>PKGINFODIR</varname> is the directory under

    <para>A package which needs the <quote>makeinfo</quote> command
    at build time must add <quote>makeinfo</quote> to

    should be noted with the <varname>TEXINFO_REQD</varname>

    be added automatically.</para>

    <para>The build and installation process of the software provided
    by the package should not use the

  <title>Marking packages as having problems</title>

  <para>In some cases one does not have the time to solve a problem
  immediately.  There are currently two ways to declare that one knows
  that a package has problems.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>The first way is to plainly mark it as broken.  For
    this, one just sets the variable <varname>BROKEN</varname> to the
    reason why the package is broken (similar to the
    <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> variable).  A user trying to build
    the package will immediately be shown this message, and the build
    will not be even tried.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>After each pkgsrc freeze period (a time when the
    tree is stabilized and a new pkgsrc branch is cut), the packages
    that were not building in the official branch build on the latest
    NetBSD release will be marked as broken on that branch.  This is
    done by setting the <varname>BROKEN_IN</varname> variable to the
    branch name (or appending the branch name to it).  If a user tries
    to build such a package and the build fails, the user gets a
    message that says that the package was broken on the respective
    branch(es).</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>Both types of packages are removed from pkgsrc in irregular
  intervals.</para>
