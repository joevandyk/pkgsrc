This is a free reimplementation of Kernighan and Bentley's grap
language for typesetting graphs, as described in ``Grap-A Language for
Typesetting Graphs, Tutorial and User Manual,'' by Jon L. Bentley and
Brian W.  Kernighan, revised May 1991, which is the primary source for
information on how to use grap.

grap is a pic pre-processor.  It takes commands embedded in a troff
source file which are surrounded by .G1 and .G2 macros, and rewrites
them into pic commands to display the graph.

Because grap is a pic preprocessor, and GNU pic will output TeX, it is
possible to use grap with TeX.
