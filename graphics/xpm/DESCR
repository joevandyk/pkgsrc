XPM (X PixMap) is a format for storing/retrieving X pixmaps to/from
files.

Here is provided a library containing a set of four functions, similar
to the X bitmap functions as defined in the Xlib: XpmCreatePixmapFromData,
XpmCreateDataFromPixmap, XpmReadFileToPixmap and XpmWriteFileFromPixmap
for respectively including, storing, reading and writing this format,
plus four other: XpmCreateImageFromData, XpmCreateDataFromImage,
XpmReadFileToImage and XpmWriteFileFromImage for working with images
instead of pixmaps.
