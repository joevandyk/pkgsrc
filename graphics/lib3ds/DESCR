The 3D Studio File Format Library is an overall software library for managing
3D-Studio Release 3 and 4 .3DS files.  It is a free alternative to Autodesk's
3DS File Toolkit for managing 3DS files.  Its main goal is to simplify the
creation of 3DS import and export filters.

This project is not related in any form to Autodesk.  The library is based on
unofficial information about the 3DS format found on the web.
