cambevao grabs images from NetBSD's or FreeBSD's /dev/bktr and ov511+ based
USB webcams and saves them as jpegs. It can be used as a console based webcam
program.

This project started as bktr2jpeg and was (for several years) a single
C-source file that supported bktr-based devices only. After adding support
for USB webcams further features got added and the list includes now an
XML-based config file and a built-in mini webserver for static and streaming
images. There is a nice interface between the camera driver and the rest of
the program, so adding new devices is not hard (beside writing the driver).
Includes rc-scripts for NetBSD's rc.d startup and shutdown scripts.
