JpGraph is an OO class library for PHP 4.3.x and later. JpGraph
makes it easy to draw both "quick and dirty" graphs with a minimum
of code and complex professional looking graphs which require a
very fine grain of control. The library assigns context sensitive
default values for most parameters which helps minimize the learning
curve.

JpGraph uses only GD, no other PHP extensions are necessary.
