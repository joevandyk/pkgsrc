GET_DS7 is a program package to get the data of pictures sequentially
from FUJIFILM DS-7(DS series) and to put them into each file.
It is programmed with Perl.

The following are required to use this program:

        - perl5.004 or later and POSIX module.
        - FUJIFILM RS232C interface cable(depend on IF-DS7/W).

Though this program has developed for DS-7, it may be available for
other FUJIFILM DS series digital cameras(ex. DS-220A,DS-8,DS-10,DS-20,
DS-30,DS-300,FinePix700,Apple QuickTake200). Fuji MX-500 also works.

"DS-7" means DS series digital cameras in this document.
