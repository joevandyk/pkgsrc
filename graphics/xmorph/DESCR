xmorph is a digital image warping and dissolving program, also known
as a "morphing" program.  It runs under the X Window System.  The
primary use of xmorph is to generate and modify meshes which control
the shape of an image.  xmorph also has the capacity to dissolve
images together, and to generate a sequence of warped and dissolved
images.  When this sequence is made into a movie, it is called a
"morph".
