GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based
on a feature extraction method. It reads a bitmap image in pbm or
pgm formats and produces text in byte (8-bit) or UTF-8 formats.

Ocrad includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or
blocks of text normally found on printed pages.
