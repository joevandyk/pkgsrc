Liquid Rescale is a free, open source implementation of the algorithm
described in the paper entitled "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing"
by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.
It aims at resizing pictures non-uniformly while preserving their features,
i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts. It supports manual feature
selection, and can also be used to remove portions of the picture in a
consistent way.
After installation, you will find it under the Layer menu in the GIMP.
