Gfract is a GTK-based fractal program that currently implements the
standard Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It features infinite image size
with infinite anti-aliasing if you have the memory for it (well, at
least 2^31 x 2^31 image sizes), Julia instant preview mode and PNG
support. For palette files it uses the same format as Fractint does.
