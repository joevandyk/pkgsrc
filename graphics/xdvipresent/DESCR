xdvipresent provides glue for developing slides for on-line presentation using
LaTeX and xdvi, and a (portable) computer with a XGA (1024x768), SVGA
(800x600), VGA (640x480), or SUN (1152x900) screen running Xwindows.  The idea
is that you prepare the slides in LaTeX with the enclosed style file(s) and
you use the "xdvipresent" script (which simply calls xdvi with an appropriate
set of options) to show the slides on the screen.
This package provides a convenient style for slideshow presentations as well.
