g2 is a simple to use graphics library for 2D graphical applications
written in Ansi-C.

This library provides a comprehensive set of functions for
simultaneous generation of graphical output on different types of
devices. Presently, following devices are currently supported by g2:
X11, GIF, PostScript (xfig and Win32 are in development).

One major feature of the g2_library is the concept of virtual
devices. An arbitrary number of physical devices (such as GIF, or X11)
can be grouped to create a so-called virtual device. Commands sent to
such a virtual devices will automatically issued to all attached
physical devices. This allows for example simultaneous output to a GIF
file and a Postscript file. A virtual device in turn can be attached
to another virtual device, allowing to construct trees of devices.
Virtual devices can also be useful when using different
user-coordinate systems. E.g. one X11 window showing an overview of a
graphical output, and a second window showing a zoom of a more
detailed area of the graphic. Drawing in both windows is performed by
one single command to the virtual device.
