Skencil is a Free Software interactive vector drawing appliction.  It is a
flexible and powerful tool for illustrations, diagrams and other purposes.

A somewhat unique (for a drawing program) feature of Skencil is that it is
implemented almost completely in a very high-level, interpreted language,
Python.  Python is powerful, object-oriented and yet easy to use.
