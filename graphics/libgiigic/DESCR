The goal of LibGIIGIC is to provide a single easy to use, but yet
powerful API for (re)binding any kind of action to all possible
input devices through LibGII at runtime.

You likely know this feature from modern computer games, where you
can say which key (= input source) is used to shoot (= action) with
your shotgun.
