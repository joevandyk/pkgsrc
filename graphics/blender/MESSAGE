Due to oddities in the blender package, running `blender' will soft-link
the global blender directory to your home directory as ~/.blender to run
properly with all scripts attached.

Customisation can be done individually by copying the directory ~/.blender
points to to your own homedirectory :
	rm -rf ~/.blender
	cp -R ${PREFIX}/share/blender ~/.blender

and customise/add your own stuff like scripts etc. in it.

To revert to `factory' settings and site-setup files, just remove the
~/.blender directory/link and the script will add the softlink again.

Note that blender will create a ~/.B.blend file that serves as the empty or
startup file with all settings in it. A file called ~/.Blog will hold the
last file edited with blender.

Executing ${PREFIX}/bin/blender-bin will bypass the convenience script
${PREFIX}/bin/blender
