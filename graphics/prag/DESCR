Prag is a simple grap(DWB) replacement.  It implements an extended
subset of grap(DWB)'s input language (sorry:).  You can draw several
graphs within one diagram, label it, set tick marks, use a grid, etc.

It is written in nawk(1) and you get the whole source code.  It's
available via anonymous ftp service from

	ftp.informatik.uni-rostock.de:/pub/local/software

Bug reports or suggested improvements should go to

	hme@informatik.uni-rostock.de

Aside some simple examples you got a rudimentary manual page.
Nevertheless the source is the best documentation.
