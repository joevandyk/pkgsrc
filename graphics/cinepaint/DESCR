CinePaint is a free open source painting and image retouching program designed
to work best with 35mm film and other high resolution high dynamic range images.
It is the most popular open source tool in the motion picture industry - used
in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, Stuart Little and other feature
films. CinePaint is used for painting of background mattes and for
frame-by-frame retouching of movies. It is being extended to do film
restoration. CinePaint is available for Linux, Macintosh OS X, Windows, and
other popular operating systems. This software was formerly known as
FilmGimp.

Animation renderers and 35mm film scanners are capable of creating greater color
bit-depth than can be displayed on monitors (8-bit per channel) or can be
manipulated in most programs. The 32-bit per channel color capacity of CinePaint
appeals most to cinematographers and professional still photographers. However,
CinePaint is a general-purpose tool useful for working on images for motion
pictures, print, and the Web. CinePaint supports many file formats, conventional
formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and TGA images -- and more exotic motion
picture digital intermediate formats such as Cineon and OpenEXR.

CinePaint is free software. The generosity and commitment of its developers,
users and sponsors make CinePaint possible.
