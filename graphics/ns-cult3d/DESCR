The Cult3D plugin enables users view interactive 3D objects,
including full transparency, reflectivity, particle systems, bump
mapping, phong shading, movement and sound.

Cult3D objects respond to the click of a mouse, letting users zoom
and spin, click and feel, move parts and experience sounds, creating
a multi-sensory experience.
