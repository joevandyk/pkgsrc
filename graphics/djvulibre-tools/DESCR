DjVu is a set of compression technologies, a file format,
and a software platform for the delivery over the Web of digital documents,
scanned documents, and high resolution images.

DjVu documents download and display extremely quickly, and look exactly the
same on all platforms. DjVu can be seen as superior alternative to PDF and
Postscript for digital documents, to TIFF (and PDF) for scanned documents, to
JPEG for photographs and pictures, and to GIF for large palettized
images. DjVu is the only Web format that is practical for distributing
high-resolution scanned documents in color. No other format comes close.
