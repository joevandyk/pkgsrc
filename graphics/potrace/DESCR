Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM,
PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector
file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned
data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can
then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
PostScript, SVG (scalable vector graphics), PGM (for easy
antialiasing of pixel-based images), and XFig. An experimental
Gimppath backend is also provided. Additional backends might be added
in the future.

A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act
as a pre-processor for potrace, applying scaling and various filters
to an image before converting it to a bitmap. This is useful for
potracing greyscale and color images.
