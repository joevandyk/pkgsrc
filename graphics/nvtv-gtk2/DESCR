Nvtv can enable, activate and configure the TV output of most NVidia cards,
and some others, such as some 3dfx ones.  Nvtv probes and uses the PCI bus
directly, thus does not need any kernel support, and allows a very low-level
access to the multiple TV encoder chips supported.  Then you have a direct
control over the registers of the chip, and can use all the resolutions and
sizes the board supports.

Most of the accesses done by Nvtv need root privileges, and a daemon is
provided to allow non-privileged users control the TV output of the graphics
card.

This package uses version 2 of the GTK+ toolkit.  If you want to use GTK+ 1
interface, install graphics/nvtv package instead.
