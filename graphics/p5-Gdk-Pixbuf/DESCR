The Gtk module allows Perl access to the Gtk+ graphical user interface
library. You can find more information about Gtk+ on http://www.gtk.org.
The Perl binding tries to follow the C interface as much as possible,
providing at the same time a fully object-oriented interface and
Perl-style calling conventions.

This is the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf extension of the Gtk module.
