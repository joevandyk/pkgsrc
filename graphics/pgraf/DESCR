Pgraf is a portable graphics package for the presentation of
scientific data.  The package is designed to operate on the simplest
of graphics devices, with implementation on a new device requiring
only the creation of a small set of low level subroutines.  The
package is written in the C language, with function calls restricted
to the standard input-output and math libraries.  However, the
graphics is accessible from both C and Fortran 77.  The functions
provided include simple graphing, contouring of two dimensional
fields, and perspective viewing of three dimensional wire frame
structures.
