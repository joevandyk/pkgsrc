Dia is a program for creating diagrams of all kinds. The current version
can do UML class diagrams, Entity-Relationship modeling, network diagrams,
and much more. The engine is very flexible and dynamically loads
diagram-types from disk. It can currently export to postscript and
load/save in an xml format.

This package provides the Python plugin for Dia.
