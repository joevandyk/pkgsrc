The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering engine.
It has been developed to provide TT support to a great variety of
platforms and environments. Notice that FreeType is a *library*.  It is
*not* a font server for your preferred environment, even though it has
been written to allow the design of many font servers.
