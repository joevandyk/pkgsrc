RRDTool::OO is an object-oriented interface to Tobi Oetiker's round
robin database tool rrdtool. It uses rrdtool's RRDs module to get
access to rrdtool's shared library.

RRDTool::OO tries to marry rrdtool's database engine with the
dwimminess and whipuptitude Perl programmers take for granted.
Using RRDTool::OO abstracts away implementation details of the RRD
engine, uses easy to memorize named parameters and sets meaningful
defaults for parameters not needed in simple cases. For the
experienced user, however, it provides full access to rrdtool's
API. (Please check "Development Status" to verify how much of it
has been implemented yet, though, since this module is under
development :).
