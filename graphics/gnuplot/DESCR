Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
for UNIX, MSDOS, and VMS platforms.  The software is copyrighted but
freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it).  It was originally
intended as graphical program which would allow scientists and students
to visualize mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot supports many
different types of terminals, plotters, and printers (including many
color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX) and is easily extensible
to include new devices.

This package includes X11 support.
