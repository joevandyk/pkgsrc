Plotmtv's capabilities include 2D line and scatter plots (x-vs-y),
contour plots, 3D surface, line and scatter plots as well as vector
plots.  The program has a rough but functional Graphical User
Interface, through which it is possible to zoom in, zoom out, pan,
toggle between 2D and 3D plots, and rotate 3D plots. Both color and
grayscale postscript output are supported.
