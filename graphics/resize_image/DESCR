resize_image is a little utility to resize images. You can read
JPEG, GIF, Targa (TGA), PBM, PGM and PPM images.  You will need
JPEG library to use it. You can only output in PPM or JPEG formats.
It is written in C so if you want to compile you'll needed a C
compiler (only tested with gcc under Linux i386).
