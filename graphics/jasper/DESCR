  The JasPer Project is a collaborative effort between Image Power, Inc.
and the University of British Columbia.  The objective of this project is
to develop a software-based reference implementation of the codec
specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1).  This
software has also been submitted to the ISO for inclusion in the JPEG-2000
Part-5 standard (as an official reference implementation).
