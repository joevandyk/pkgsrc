Image_Graph provides a set of classes that creates graphs/plots/charts based on
(numerical) data.

Many different plot types are supported: Bar, line, area, step, impulse,
scatter, radar, pie, map, candlestick, band, box & whisker and smoothed line,
area and radar plots.

The graph is highly customizable, making it possible to get the exact look
and feel that is required.

The output is controlled by a Image_Canvas, which facilitates easy output to
many different output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP), PDF
(using PDFLib), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
