Cal3d is a skeletal based 3d character animation library written in C++ in
a platform-/graphic API-independent way. Originally designed to be used in a
3d client for Worldforge, it evolved into a stand-alone product which can be
used in many different kinds of projects. Check out the Cal3d FAQ for more
detailed info.
