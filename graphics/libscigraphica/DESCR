SciGraphica is an Open Source data analysis and visualisation tool. It
pretends to be a clone of Microcal Origin but with the aim to be fully
featured, cross-platform, user-friendly scientific package that through
its Open Source nature can be extended and/or bugfixed by users, as well
as being user-extensible with Python modules.

This package contains the support library, which is separated from the
graphical user interface.
