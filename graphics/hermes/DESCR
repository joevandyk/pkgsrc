Hermes is intended for use in graphics libraries or directly in
graphics programs. In the beginning the goal was to provide the
fastest possible routines for the purpose Hermes was designed for,
thus the target were fast graphics libraries for games and the
sort.  However, lately more and more choice for high-quality
rendering is being built in so things like photorealistic rendering
software might profit from the speed of Hermes in the very near
future.

The library is straight-forward to use. There are about 8 functions
you will need to know about for a simple application and probably
twice as many for a more complicated one. It should take about 10
minutes to build Hermes into your code.
