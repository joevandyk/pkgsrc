Libungif is a giflib-compatible library and tools that saves GIFs using
an uncompressed algorithm that avoids the Unisys patent on the LZW
compression algorithm.

The tools include programs to clip, rotate, scale, and position
GIF images.  It includes code to dump GIFs to an Epson-compatible printer
in graphics mode, and several conversion utilities.

The library includes program-callable entry points for reading and writing
GIF files, an 8x8 utility font for embedding text in GIFs, and an error
handler.  GIF manipulation can be done at a relatively low level by
sequential I/O (which automatically undoes image compression) or at
a higher level by slurping an entire GIF into allocated core.
