OpenCV means Intel(R) Open Source Computer Vision Library. It is a
collection of C functions and a few C++ classes that implement many
popular Image Processing and Computer Vision algorithms.

OpenCV provides cross-platform middle-to-high level API that includes
about 300 C functions and a few C++ classes. Also there are Python
bindings to OpenCV. OpenCV has no strict dependencies on external
libraries, though it can use some (such as libjpeg, ffmpeg, GTK+ etc.)

OpenCV provides transparent interface to Intel(R) Integrated Performance
Primitives (IPP). That is, it loads automatically IPP libraries optimized
for specific processor at runtime, if they are available.
