  cdlabelgen is a program for generating frontcards and traycards for
CDs.  cdlabelgen was designed to simplify the process of generating
labels for CD's.  It originated as a program to allow auto generation
of frontcards and traycards for CD's burned via an automated mechanism
(specifically for archiving data), but has now become popular for
labelling CD compilations, and copies of CDs.

  Note that cdlabelgen does not actually print anything -- it just
spits out postscript, which you can then do with as you please.

  cdlabelgen's purpose in life is twofold:

  1.) To be run automatically and swiftly from a shell script
      and automatically generate a frontcard and a traycard for
      a cd--usually data archive cd's.  The traycard (which goes
      behind the CD itself) is U-shaped and the ends of the CD
      case bear the label of what the CD is.

  2.) To have a minimum of dependencies -- cdlabelgen only
      requires perl.
