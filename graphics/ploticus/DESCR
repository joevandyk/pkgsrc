Ploticus is a new free software package for Unix that creates graphical data
displays for web pages and intranets, paper reports, posters, slides, or
interactive use.  Ploticus is script-driven and can be invoked automatically
(automated) from web servers and other programs.  Ploticus can work with flat
ascii or spreadsheet data sets that can include numerics and text as well as
dates and times in a wide variety of notations.  It also has built-in
capability of computing frequency distributions, cross-tabs, medians,
quartiles, and curve fitting.  It is the successor to IPL, a freeware plotting
program by the same author, released in 1989.
