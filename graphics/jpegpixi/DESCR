Jpegpixi is short for JPEG Pixel Interpolator. The intent of the
program is to interpolate pixels (single pixels, dots, stripes) in
JPEG images.  This is useful to correct images from a digital camera
with CCD defects.  For example, if one pixel is always bright green,
this pixel can be interpolated with jpegpixi.

Jpegpixi is unique in that it tries to preserve the quality of the
JPEG image as much as possible.  Usual graphics programs decode JPEG
images when they are loaded, and re-encode them when they are saved,
which results in an overall loss of quality.  Jpegpixi, on the other
hand, only decodes the DCT blocks (typically 8x8, 16x8, or 16x16 pixel
areas) which contain pixels to be interpolated, and when it re-encodes
them, it uses exactly the same parameters with which the image has
originally been encoded.  These blocks are therefore only minimally
disturbed, and other blocks remain pixel-by-pixel identical to the
original image.
