ps2eps is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript
Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript documents.  It
calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some
special postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous
results on printers.  EPS files are often needed for including
(scalable) graphics of high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word)
documents.
