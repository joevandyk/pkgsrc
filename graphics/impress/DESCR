ImPress is a WYSIWYG layout program.  It allows you to create presentations
and Postscript documents using fully scalable graphics similar to programs
like Macromedia Freehand, Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator and Visio.  It is
different from raster graphic packages like gimp, Adobe PhotoShop and
Jasc's PaintShop Pro in that it deals with graphical objects which can be
manipulated on a canvas rather than just layers of paint.
