ODS, the Open Digita Services project, is an effort to write open
source tools for accessing Digita cameras from unix operating systems.

ODS has been tested with and is known to work with the following cameras:

               Kodak DC-220
               Kodak DC-260
               Kodak DC-265
               Kodak DC-290

The Minolta EX-1500 has been reported to work with ODS, but the
interface needs some debugging.

ODS will not support cameras that don't use Digita; this includes the
Kodak DC-200, DC-210, DC-240, DC-280, and earlier cameras.
