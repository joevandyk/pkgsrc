The package is meant to solve most needs in barcode creation with a
conventional printer. It can create printouts for the conventional
product tagging standards: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN, as well
as a few other formats. Output is generated as either Postscript or
Encapsulated Postscript (other back-ends may be added if needed).

The package is released as both a library and a command-line frontend,
so that you can include barcode-generation into your application.
