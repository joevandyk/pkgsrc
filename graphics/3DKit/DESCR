  The GNU 3DKit is officially part of the GNU project!  It is an extension
to GNUstep, which provides an object oriented application development
framework and tool set for use on a wide variety of computer platforms.
GNUstep is based on the original OpenStep specification provided by NeXT,
Inc. (now Apple).  Of course, the GNU 3DKit also works on Mac OS X using
the Cocoa API.  It is truly a multiplatform graphics API!

  The GNU 3DKit's main purpose is to provide an elegant foundation commonly
required to write 3D applications. The 3DKit uses OpenGL as backend.  The
kit consists of multiple libraries, all written in Objective-C: the
GeometryKit, the RenderKit, the SDLKit, the GlutKit, and the GLXKit.

The GNU 3DKit currently provides the following features:
    * a customisable, simple scenegraph architecture containing grouping
      nodes, level of detail nodes, switch nodes and so on.
    * basic graph optimisation capabilities
    * view-frustum culling
    * support for all OpenGL lighting modes
    * optimised state handling
    * texture mapping
    * support for vertex arrays, display lists etc.
    * transparent bounding volume handling (spheres and AABB)
    * direct support for GLX, SDL and glut
    * optimised linear algebra and some physics code
