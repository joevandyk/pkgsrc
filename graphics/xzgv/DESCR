xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.
It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported, and the
thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also
be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector.
For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man
xzgv' once it's installed.

xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one
window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows
both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures,
and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's
aspect ratio without you telling it to.

It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the
keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it
doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.
