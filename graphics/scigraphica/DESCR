SciGraphica is a scientific application for data analysis and technical
graphics. It pretends to be a clone of the popular commercial (and expensive)
application "Microcal Origin". It fully supplies plotting features for 2D, 3D
and polar charts. The aim is to obtain a fully-featured, cross-plattform,
user-friendly, self-growing scientific application. It is free and open-source,
released under the GPL license.
