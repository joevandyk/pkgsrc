LibVideoGfx is a C++ library for low-level video processing. It aims at
speeding up the development process for image and video processing applications
by providing high-level classes for commonly required tasks. The library
comprises support for:

    basic image data classes
    color-space conversion for RGB, YUV, HSV
    drawing primitives (lines, circles, ...)
    image manipulation (scaling, pixel-ops, convolution)
    file-IO (ppm, yuv, jpeg, png, mpeg, V4L-grabbing)
    X11 image display (including Xv-extension support)
