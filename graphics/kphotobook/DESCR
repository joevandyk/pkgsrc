KPhotoBook is a powerful, easy to use, intuitive and fast application to
manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate
your photos with tags and to refind the photos using the given tags.
The tags which can be created by yourself are arranged in a tree.

The KPhotoBook GUI comes up with several points which makes the handling
with many photos very easy. This is just a short excerpt of it's goodies:

* It is very easy to annotate tags to one or more images at a time
* It is very easy to find images by the given tags (actually one mouse
  click only is needed)
* It is very easy to edit the image database with an external program -
  it's saved as XML file
