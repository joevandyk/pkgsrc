It is an extension to GNUstep, which provides an object oriented
application development framework and tool set for use on a wide
variety of computer platforms. GNUstep is based on the original
OpenStep specification provided by NeXT, Inc. (now Apple). Additionally
the GNU 3DKit may also be used on Mac OS X using the Cocoa API.

The GNU 3DKit's main purpose is to provide an elegant foundation
commonly required to write 3D applications.

The kit consists of 2 frameworks and some bundles, all written in
Objective-C:

* The GeometryKit implements often required mathematical functionality.
* The RenderKit implements the core rendering API.

* An OpenGL based preview renderer.
* A raytracing based high quality renderer.

The emphasis of the kit lies in a clean, object-oriented design
which enables ease of use and high performance rendering.
