libwmf is a library for UNIX-like machines that can convert wmf
(Windows Meta Files) files into other formats.  Currently it supports
a gd binding to convert to png, and an X one to draw direct to an X
window or pixmap. It also comes with a program to display wmfs: wmf2x.

Without a TrueType font server and the standard MS Windows fonts, the X
binding might render text in a different font than would appear under
MS Windows natively (this is a runtime issue for the wmf2x program).
