The libcaca library is a graphics library that outputs text instead
of pixels, so that it can work on older video cards or text terminals.
It is not unlike the famous AAlib library. libcaca needs a terminal
to work, thus it should work on all Unix systems (including Mac OS
X) using either the slang library or the ncurses library.

The differences with AAlib are the following:

  * 16 available colours for character output (256 colour pairs)
  * dithering of colour images
  * basic sprite primitives

But libcaca also has the following limitations:

  * no support for brightness, contrast, gamma
  * unefficient character-choosing algorithms
  * no alternate fonts
  * no raw keyboard support
  * no custom output drivers a la AA-on-X
