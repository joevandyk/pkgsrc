This is the GLU polygon tessellation facility for Mesa implemented by Bogdan
Sikorski.  The tessellation module is provided under the same terms as the
Mesa package.

This software tries to be fully compliant with the OpenGL routines. By
"tries" I mean that up to my knowledge it behaves as OpenGL tessellation
routines.  However, the author makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a
compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with Silicon Graphics, Inc.
Those who want a licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed
vendor.  This software is distributed under the terms of the GNU Library
General Public License, see the LICENSE file for details.
