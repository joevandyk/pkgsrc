The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software
system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization used by
thousands of researchers and developers around the world. VTK consists of a
C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers including
Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. Professional support and products for VTK are
provided by Kitware, Inc. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization
algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric
methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modelling,
polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay
triangulation. In addition, dozens of imaging algorithms have been directly
integrated to allow the user to mix 2D imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and
data. The design and implementation of the library has been strongly
influenced by object-oriented principles. VTK has been installed and tested
on nearly every Unix-based platform, PCs (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP), and Mac
OSX Jaguar or later.
