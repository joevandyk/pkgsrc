GIF320 3.0 is a gif file viewer for use with VT-320 terminals. It
should be easily portable to any platform as it uses only printf and
several other stdio commands; some signal trapping and tilde-globbing
is also provided, but can be configured out.

Note that GIF320 uses some obscure character-set definition escape
sequences, so if you use a VT-320 emulator or a VT-320 clone, it may
not work. It will not work on a 220 or a 420, although the 420
claims to emulate a 320. Unfortunately, I don't have access to a
420, so I'm looking for someone with a VT-420, a manual, and intricate
knowledge of escape sequences to hack on one for me and find out why
not.
