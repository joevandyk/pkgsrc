Exifprobe reads image files produced by digital cameras (including
several so-called "raw" file formats) and reports the structure of
the files and the auxilliary data and metadata contained within them.
In addition to TIFF, JPEG, and EXIF, the program understands several
formats which may contain "raw" camera data, including MRW, CIFF/CRW,
JP2/JPEG2000, RAF, and X3F, as well as most most TIFF-derived "raw"
formats, including DNG, ORF, CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR, and PEF.
