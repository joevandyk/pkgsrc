The Template-GD distribution provides a number of Template Toolkit
plugin modules to interface with Lincoln Stein's GD modules. These in
turn provide an interface to Thomas Boutell's GD graphics library.

These plugins were distributed as part of the Template Toolkit until
version 2.15 released in February 2006. At this time they were extracted
into this separate distribution.

For general information on the Template Toolkit see the documentation
for the Template module or <http://template-toolkit.org>. For
information on using plugins, see Template::Plugins and "USE" in
Template::Manual::Directives.
