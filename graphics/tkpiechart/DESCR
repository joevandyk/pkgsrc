Some people have asked for a Tcl/Tk pie utility: so here is my little
implementation with Tcl, not as an extension.

This is version 3.0.2. It was tested with Tcl8.0/Tk8.0 and the
netscape plug-in 2.0b3 or above.

It is object oriented using the stooop (Simple Tcl Only Object
Oriented Programming) extension (version 3.0 or above, tcl file
included).

Whether you like it (or hate it), please let me know. I would like to
hear about bugs and improvements you would like to see. I will correct
the bugs quickly, especially if you send me a test script.

If you find a bug in the Tcl code and correct it yourself, please
email the modified code so I can include it in the next release. The
same goes for improvements.
