LibGGIMisc is a place to put support for graphics target features
which are not deserving their own special extensions.  Right now
this means basically some VGA adaptor features -- getting and
waiting for the raster position, using a hardware horizontal
splitline feature, and loading/unloading font data from hardware
text modes.
