Ncview is an X Windows visual browser for netCDF data format files.
Ncview displays a 2-dimensional, color representation of data in a
netCDF file.  You can animate the data in time (making simple movies),
flip or enlarge the picture, scan through various axes, change
colormaps, etc.  You can also plot the data in X-Y plots and then
print those, courtesy of the SciPlot widget.
