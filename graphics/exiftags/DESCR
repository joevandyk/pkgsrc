The exiftags utility parses a specified JPEG file or, by default,
its standard input, looking for a JPEG APP1 section containing Exif
(Exchangeable Image File) image metadata. The properties contained
in these data are then printed to the standard output. Digital
cameras typically add Exif data to the image files they produce,
containing information about the camera and digitized image.

The program supports a variety of cameras, and includes additional
support for a portion of the maker notes for Canon, Casio, Fuji,
Nikon, and Olympus cameras. Currently this program runs under
Windows and Unix-like operating systems.

An included companion utility, exifcom, displays and writes the
UserComment Exif tag that some cameras include in the image metadata
they create. This program is useful for recording caption or location
information in the image file itself.
