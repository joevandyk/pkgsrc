Geomview is the product of an effort at the Geometry Center at the
University of Minnesota to provide interactive geometry software which
is particularly appropriate for mathematics research and education.
In particular, geomview can display things in hyperbolic and spherical
space as well as Euclidean space.

Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and
cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances
(including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or
Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided
through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
interactive control of everything else.

Geomview supports the following simple data types: polyhedra with
shared vertices (.off), quadrilaterals, rectangular meshes,
vectors, and Bezier surface patches of arbitrary degree including
rational patches.  Object hierarchies can be constructed with
lists of objects and instances of object(s) transformed by one or
many 4x4 matrices.  Arbitrary portions of changing hierarchies
may be transmitted by creating named references.
