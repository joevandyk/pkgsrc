FreeType is a portable, high-quality software solution for digital
typography.  FreeType 1.3.1 was the last release of the FreeType 1
engine, as the project is now switching to a new version dubbed FreeType
2.  It has, among other things, several advantages over FreeType 1:

 * A universal and simple API to manage font files
 * Support for several font formats through loadable drivers
 * Even more portable
 * An improved anti-aliasing algorithm
