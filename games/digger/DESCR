Digger was originally created by Windmill software in 1983 and
released as a copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the
IBM PC. As it requires a genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern
PCs.

In 1998, I created Digger Remastered, which runs on all PCs with
CGA or better and plays just like the original. It also has many
new features, including:
  * Exit button
  * Optional VGA graphics
  * Recording and playback
  * Real time speed control
  * Keyboard redefinition
  * Gauntlet mode
  * Two player simultaneous mode
