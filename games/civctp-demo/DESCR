Civilization: Call to Power is the latest in the line of the
"Civilization" games. Build up your civilization from the dawn of
the Stone Age until it reaches for the stars--and beyond.

Through conquest, cooperation, skulduggery and innovation, you can
build a civilization for the ages--or land on the scrapheap of
history. If you're feeling invincible, you can test your mettle
online or over a network against multiple players. For strategy
game fans, this is a must-have.

This is the free demo version - a full version is available from
