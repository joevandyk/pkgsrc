LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. Instead of
assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. Nevertheless, the basic
game play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will not stop until it
hits a wall or another marble. To make it more interesting there are obstacles
like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals.
As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not
a time limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
