  Corewars is a simulation game where a number of warriors try to
crash each other while they are running in a virtual computer. The
warriors can be written in one of two assembler-like languages called
Corewars and Redcode. Corewars is the default language and is easier
to learn and understand. Redcode provides more advanced and powerful
instructions but also requires more time to learn.

  You can watch your warriors while they are running in the main
program window. A statistic window will give you live coverage of
just how well your warriors are doing. A tournament mode will allow
you to run you own tournaments on your computer.
