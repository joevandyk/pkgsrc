XJig is a puzzle, that tries to replicate a jigsaw puzzle on the
screen as close as possible. Gif-images can be loaded and sliced into
pieces and as in every jigsaw puzzle, the goal is to set the parts
together again.

Special effects:
- Tiles are freely rotatable with intuitive pointer movement.
- Tiles can even be flipped to their back (to mirror them).
- Tiles can be shown as shaped windows on the desktop.

Restrictions:
- The game needs a C++ - compiler (tested with gcc-2.7.0 and HP's CC)
- The game works only on color monitors.
- For the texture-mapping routines, you might a bit of machine power
  to make them look good (it runs very smooth on my Pentium 90).

Have fun.
