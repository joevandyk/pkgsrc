Throw away Doom, Quake and Duke Nukem - 0verkill comes. Now you don't even need
graphic mode if you wanna take a bloody deathmatch with your friends.

The ASCII art that has always fascinated you started to move finally.
No one has ever thought that ASCII is an animable kind of art.
Finally you can taste the original appearance of elaborate action in full
16 colors of your plain old text terminal. You never thought that ASCII letters
are capable of network-game action in such a massive manner.

No one ever connected gushing blood with that innocent ASII letters that were
so utterly boring until recently, when 0verkill was released.
