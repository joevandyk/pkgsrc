Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game
which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration of
a dungeon complex.  You control a fictional character described by
race, class, attributes, skills, and equipment.  This fictional
character is trying to achieve a specific goal (see below) and succeed
in a difficult quest.  To fulfill the quest, you have to explore
previously undiscovered tunnels and dungeons, fight hideous monsters,
uncover long forgotten secrets, and find treasures of all kind.
