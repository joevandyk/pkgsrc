eboard is a chess interface for Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris, etc.) based on the GTK+ GUI toolkit. It provides a chess board
interface to ICS (Internet Chess Servers) like FICS and to chess engines
like GNU Chess, Sjeng and Crafty.

eboard provides many features other interfaces lack, like a good
looking, configurable interface, multiple board views, resizeable board
(without restarting), seek table, text input separated from the output,
input history (bash-like), scripting, scroll lock, and many others.
