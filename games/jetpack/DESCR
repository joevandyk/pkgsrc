Jetpack is an arcade action game. The user controls a player wearing a
jetpack.  The player must travel through the maze to find a key and
bring it back to the door to exit to the next level.  There are three
kinds of enemies in jetpack: guards, fireballs and wall sweepers.
Touching any enemy is fatal.  Guards patrol the maze.  They
fly in the middle of the corridors and follow random paths through the
maze.  Fireballs fly through space and bounce off walls.  Wall
Sweepers cling to walls and continuously move along the surface of the
walls.  They can hang on to any side, and when they reach the end of a
wall, flip to hug the other side and continue in the opposite
direction.
