Netmaze is a multiplayer combat game (like the Atari Midi Maze game)

You play in a virtual maze and the goal of the game is to hunt down your
opponents.  The view is full animated 3D.  On fast machines, you can even
run it with texture mapping for the walls and floor.

There are also three robot players of varying ability.
