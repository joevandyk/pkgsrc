  glchess has now been installed in ${PREFIX}.  To play against the
  computer, you need to set up the path to an installed gnuchessx
  or crafty chess engine.

  To change settings, you need to create ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/glchessrc
  containing system-wide settings or .glchessrc in a user's home
  directory for per-user configuration.  The default configuration
  can be found in ${PREFIX}/etc/glchessrc.default
