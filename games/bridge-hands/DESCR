Hands is a program to generate bridge hands for a duplicate game.  The
program writes output to the terminal ("Standard out") which may be
redirected to a file or a printer.  The output is suitable for printing on
8 1/2 x 11 inch pages using any fixed-pitch font at 12 characters per inch,
such as 10-point Courier, or for redirection to any Postcript printer or
compatible interpreter.
