Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game where you drive some kind
of car across the moon's surface. Unfortunately there are dangerous
craters there. Fortunately your car can jump over them!

The game has some resemblance of the classic arcade game moon-patrol
which was released in 1982. A clone of this game was relased for the
Commodore C64 in 1983. The present, ASCII art version of moon-buggy was
written many years later by Jochen Voss.
