CGoban-java (CGoban 3) is a port of the SGF editor of CGoban 1 to Java
combined with a client for the Kiseido Go Server.  It is missing the Go
Modem Protocol adapter from CGoban 1 and the IGS/NNGS client from cgoban
1, but the SGF editor is a bit better (and of course the KGS client in
it is much better than the IGS/NNGS client in CGoban 1).
