Qonk is a small build-and-conquer strategy game with very simple
rules. A complete game only lasts for a few minutes and can be a
fun break away from work or whatever you're doing.

The setting of the game is a solar system of planets. Your goal is
to conquer all of the planets in the game by sending ships there.
Planets that are under your control generate new ships. Simple AI
players are playing against you. As you gain more experience
throughout the game, more AI players have to be kicked out of bigger
solar systems.
