Mah Jongg is an ancient chinese game usually played by four players, named
after the four winds, who take tiles similar to dominos from a wall in turn.

THEORY OF PLAY
The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board.  Tiles are
removed in by matching two identical tiles which have either an open left edge
or open right edge.  The only exception to this rule is that any open "flower"
tile (bamboo, orchid, plum, or chrysanthemum) matches any other open "flower"
tile and any open "season" tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches
any other open "season" tile.
