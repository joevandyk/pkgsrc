A Rick Dangerous (TM) clone, a famous platform game many moons ago.
Legal status is a bit shrouded. From the enclosed README:

** IMPORTANT NOTE **********************************************************

I have written the xrick code. However, graphics and maps and sounds
are by the authors of the original Rick Dangerous game, and "Rick
Dangerous" remains a trademark of its owner(s) -- maybe Core Design
(who wrote the game) or FireBird (who published it). I have not been
successful at contacting Core Design.
