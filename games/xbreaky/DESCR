  Xbreaky is an X11 version of the classical arcade game 'breakout'.  The goal
of writing this program was to get a well working game, which was fun to play.
Of course the program isn't perfect yet, the author is still working on a lot
of extra game modes, removing bugs and speeding up the overall performance.
