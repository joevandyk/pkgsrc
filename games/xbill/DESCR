Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?

You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The
little people running around the screen are trying to infect your
computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a
popular operating system.  Your objective is to click the mouse on them,
ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a computer,
it will attempt to replace your operating system with the virus it
carries.  It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital
software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your computers is being
productive.  Additionally, some computers are connected with network
cables.  When one computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will
be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other end
when it reaches there.
