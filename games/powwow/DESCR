powwow is a client program, which replaces telnet for the lazy
mudder who wants some (only some?) extra features.
It is primarily designed for DikuMUDs, but nothing prevents its use
for other types of muds.  powwow is based on another client, cancan,
and cancan was originally inspired by tintin (yet another client)
by Peter Unold (pjunold@daimi.aau.dk), but is entirely re-written.
powwow also implements the MUME remote editing protocol, which
enables you to edit texts on the mud using your own favourite
editor, several texts at once if you have a windowing terminal.
