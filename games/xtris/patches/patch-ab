+IPv6 Patch for xtris-1.15
+
+IPv6 patch for xtris is originally developed by H.YOSHIFUJi
+<yoshfuji@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp> in early December 1999.
+
+IPv6 support is enabled by defining INET6 macro during the 
+compilation phase.  This switches xtris into the protocol 
+independent world (not IPv6 (or IPv4) specific world).  
+Thus, if you have getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() defined
+in RFC2553, you can enable this feature even if you don't
+have IPv6 environment currently.
+
+The following IPv6 platforms should be supported:
+	GNU/Linux with glibc-2.1.2
+	FreeBSD {2.2.8,3.3} with KAME package
+	Solaris 7 with IPv6_Prototype_01 package
+
+Note: On Solaris 7 + IPv6_Prototype_01 systems, you should 
+      register the port number in /etc/services file.
+      There is "ad hoc" solution, but I hate it because
+      it looks "dirty"; it discards the pure protocol 
+      independent socket programming model.
