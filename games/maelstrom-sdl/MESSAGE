If you wish the screen resolution to be changed to 640x480 when
Maelstrom is run, make sure that 640x480 is a valid mode for your X
server, and run Maelstrom like so:

	Maelstrom -fullscreen


If you want faster frame-rates, you can do so (for a small security
trade-off) using X11's DGA. Make the Maelstrom executable setuid root
and set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment variable to "dga" before
running Maelstrom. If you don't know how to do this, don't worry about
it; Maelstrom is plenty fast on most hardware.
