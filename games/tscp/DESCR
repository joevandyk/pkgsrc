TSCP is intended for people who want to learn about chess programming. Its
source code is designed to be very easy to understand.

The TSCP "package" includes this README file, the TSCP source code, and a copy
of TSCP for Windows 95/98/NT. The executable was made with Visual C++ 6.0
(optimizations set to Maximize Speed).

To use TSCP, run the executable and type "help" at the prompt. It's very
straightforward.

There is a page for TSCP benchmarks: http://ucsu.colorado.edu/~kerrigat/bench/
