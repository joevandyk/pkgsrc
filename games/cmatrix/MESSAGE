In case you have X11 installed, you can use

	${PREFIX}/share/cmatrix/mtx.pcf

as your terminal font to make cmatrix look more like original.

To do that, copy the file to ${X11BASE}/lib/X11/fonts/misc, then
execute mkfontdir there; on running X you can then execute "xset fp rehash"
to make the X server refresh its font list. Remember to use "-l" option to
cmatrix then!
