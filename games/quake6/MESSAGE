For running quake, you'll need to grab data files in
quakesw-1.0.6.tar.gz and place it into your current directory.

Take a look at the following URL for "quake over IPv6" testing:
http://www.viagenie.qc.ca/en/ipv6-quake.shtml

The patch needs more work for full IPv4/IPv6 support - we welcome
comments.
