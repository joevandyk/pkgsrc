This archive contains Freeciv, a free Civilization clone for Unix and X.
This version only allows multiplayer games, and limited support for AI
players.

You should check out the home page, as it contains much more information
than this file and the online help. This is also where we'll inform people
about new releases/bugs/fixes/competitions, etc.

This package contains the Freeciv client with an interface built on top of
either gtk, gtk2, xaw, xaw3d, sdl, or just plain x11.
