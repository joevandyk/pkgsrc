 .SH TIME CONTROLS
 .PP
 If one argument is given, it is the search time per move in 
 [minutes:]seconds.
 So 
-.B gnuchess 30
+.B gnuchess4 30
 will generate one move every 30 seconds, while
-.B gnuchess 5:00
+.B gnuchess4 5:00
 will generate one move every 5 minutes.
 
 If two or more arguments are given, they will be used to set tournament
 time controls with the first argument of each pair being the number of moves and the second
 being the total clock time in minutes[:seconds].  Thus, entering 
-.B gnuchess 60 5
+.B gnuchess4 60 5
 will set
 the clocks for 5 minutes (300 seconds) for the first 60 moves,
 and 
-.B gnuchess 30 3:30
+.B gnuchess4 30 3:30
 will allow 3 minutes and 30 seconds for 30 moves.
 
-.B gnuchess 30 5 1 :30
+.B gnuchess4 30 5 1 :30
 will allow 5 minutes for the first 30 moves and 30 seconds for each move after that.
 Up to 4 pairs of controls may be specified.
