The hermit worm (THEW) is a curses-based game similar to an old version of the
C64 Snake game. It works with the arrow keys and with the vi-like keys h, j, k
and l. It is possible to enter in auto-mode where THEW play without user
interaction useful to use it as console screensaver. There is a "status bar"
with several informations: scores, speed level, user moves, number of "numbers"
to eat before switch to the next level, and others. You have constantly two
squares with the current worm position and the position of the current number
to eat. Enjoy game!
