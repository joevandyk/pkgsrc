  Cbzone is a version of Battlezone derived from the Fortran
sources written by Justin S. Revenaugh.  This version is more
flexible in that the number of opponents is user selectable.

  Input to the game is primarily through the mouse, although
some keyboard commands are accepted.  Mouse left button will
fire a salvo; mouse right button will switch between low/high
sensitivity (sensitivity determines how sensitive the joystick is to
pointer motion).  On a three button mouse, the middle button will
center the joystick and stop your tank.  This facility can be done
ona two button mouse by hitting both buttons at the same time.
Directional control of the tank is by moving the mouse to
different portions of the screen.  The joystick in the lower right
hand of the screen will correspond to your tanks current movement
and rotation.
