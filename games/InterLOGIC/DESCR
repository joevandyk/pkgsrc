The game InterLOGIC is based on the old Amiga logic game "Balls".
The object of the game is to move balls of different colors through
a maze, connecting them with other balls of the same color. Two or
more connected balls of the same color will disappear. The aim of
the game is to clean the whole maze in this way.  The balls are
connected if they are right next to each other horizontally or
vertically, but not diagonally.  The current release contains 30
mind-breaking levels for you to solve.
