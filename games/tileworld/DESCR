Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" (a registered
trademark of Bridgestone Multimedia) created by Chuck Sommerville for
the Atari Lynx.

The player navigates Chip through various challenges and obstacles.
The levels may have teleports, tools, protective gear, chips, keys,
and other items. The goal is to reach the exit tile which takes you
to the next level. Some levels have time limits.
