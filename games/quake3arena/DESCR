Quake III Arena, developed by the gaming wizards at id Software,
is the third installment of one of the most popular computer game
franchises of all time. Organic caverns, gothic cathedrals and
futuristic spacescapes play host to Quake III Arena's unrivaled
blend of action, strategy and jaw-dropping technology as Linux
gamers are invited to square off against 32 of history's greatest
warriors. Built around a revolutionary new graphics engine capable
of delivering mind blowing 3D special effects including curved
surfaces and volumetric fog, Quake III Arena is the final word in
deathmatching mayhem.

Note that this requires that you have a 100% full OpenGL compliant
3-D video card and driver. Quake III Arena uses the OpenGL API for
3-D hardware acceleration. There is no software-only version of
the game. If your computer is not hardware accelerated with a game
compatible graphics card, you will NOT be able to run the Q3A demo.
Currently, only drivers for 3dfx based cards are included in the
demo install. For updates on GL drivers, in particular for the
Matrox G200/G400, see http://www.lokigames.com/support/gldrivers/.

This is the binary only for the full version - the data files are
not included.
