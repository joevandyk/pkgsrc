You are a Viking, and, one fine day, after drinking a bit to much beer,
you fall out with the leader of your settlement. After several
unpleasantries, the upshot of it all is that you and two of your equally
drunken companions have to make a break for it!. An historic moment,
because you three guys establish a new nation. Since you are obviously
even too lazy to work, your companions vote you to be King. So let's have
a look and see whether you have what it takes to build up a new and
powerful kingdom, or whether you are just another one of life's losers. To
make things a wee bit tricky there just happens to be a few more of your
sort, trying to establish their own kingdoms; so a few problems along the
way are certainly foreseeable. Your main task is to command your own
citizens.
