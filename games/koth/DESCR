King of the Hill, KOTH, is an artillery game in the grand old
tradition of little tanks with ridiculously powerful weapons trying to
blow each other up while trying to avoid getting blown up themselves.
The story above is just one possible justification for why a bunch of
tanks would be up in the mountains shooting at each other.  Feel free
to make up your own, or simply enjoy the game.
