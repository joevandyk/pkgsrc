Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle
Isle.

The outcome of the war lies in your hands. You decide which units
are sent to the front lines, and when to unleash the reserves. Your
mission objectives range from defending strategically vital locations
to simply destroying all enemy forces in the area. Protect supply
convoys or raid enemy facilities to uncover technological secrets
or fill your storage bays so you can repair damaged units or build
new ones in your own factories. Lead your troops to victory!

Tools are available to create custom maps and campaigns. You can
also play the original Battle Isle maps if you have a copy of the
game.

You can pit yourself against another human player either in hot-seat
mode in front of the same machine or via e-mail, or against the
computer.
