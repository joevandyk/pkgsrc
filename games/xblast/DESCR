XBlast is a multi-player arcade game for X11R5/R6. The game can be played
with at least two players and up to four players. It was inspired by
the video/computer game Bomberman(Dynablaster), which was to my
knowledge first programmed for NEC's PC Engine/Turbo Grafx. Other
(commercial) versions of the original game exist for IBM-PC, Atari ST,
Amiga, NES, GameBoy and Super NES.
