Moria is a Roguelike game with a different sense of scale than Rogue.
It features a town level, with an endless(?) dungeon.  But rather than
being limited to one terminal screen in size, each dungeon level is
several screens wide and long.  Games of Moria generally take weeks to
complete, rather than hours or days.
