Monsterz is a little puzzle game, similar to the famous Bejeweled
or Zookeeper.

The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either
horizontally or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of
two adjacent monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of
three or more. When alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the
top of the screen to fill the board again. Chain reactions earn
you even more points.

This game is mostly about luck, but it remains highly addictive.
You have been warned.
