Majesty is a unique sim putting you in the crushed velvet hotseat
of your own kingdom.  With an epic quest before you, you make the
decisions of where to build your settlement`s guilds and temples.
Each one has a mind of its own and must be enticed to meet your
goals, via rewards you offer and spells you cast.

Meanwhile you must make sure that your treasury stays flush with
cash to support these and other outlays necessary to maintain a
thriving medieval town. The fact that you are being barraged by
attacks from mythical beasts and fantastic creatures doesn`t make
your job any easier.

This is the demo of the Linux version.
