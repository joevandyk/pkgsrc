iMaze is a multi-player network action game for TCP/IP with 3D graphics
under X11/XView and Motif.

It has successfully broken down the local FORTRAN lessons.

Other features include:
- sophisticated, reliable network protocol, works even with SLIP connections
  via modem
- windows can be freely scaled to avoid speed drawbacks due to poor display
  performance
- modular, portable source code
- scores
- extensive documentation (german)

After hours of testing, dueling and enjoying MidiMaze 2 on the Atari ST we
decided that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to write something similar for
Unix. "iMaze" means "Internet Maze" and by a strange coincidence it is also
a substring of "MidiMaze".
