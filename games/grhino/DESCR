GRhino, or Rhino its former name, is an Othello/Reversi game.

What distinguish GRhino from most other Othello games is that
GRhino will be targeted for experienced Othello players.
Strong AI is the main focus with some additional good, useful
features (like an endgame solver) is planned. The ultimate
target strength of the AI is that it should be able to beat
the best human player at the highest difficulty level.
