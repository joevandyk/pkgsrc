XEvil is a 3rd person, side-view, fast-action, kill-them-before-they-kill-you
game. Fight against either computer-controlled enemies, or another player.

You sinned in life. And now you must pay. Satan pits the recently deceased
against each other to fight for rank in Hell. Your skill determines your fate
for all eternity. This contest is known as XEvil.
