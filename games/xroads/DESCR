XRoads is a game for the X Windows system that attempts to be like
the game Crossroads (and its sequel, Pandemonium) for the Commodore
64. Basically, it is a 2-dimensional, overhead view maze game in
which you fight against a gang of monsters. Sounds simple? Guess
again! There are (or at least, there will be) tons of different
twists in the game which make it fun.
