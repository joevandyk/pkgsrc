ColChess is primarily an analysis engine, though it can also be used for
playing competitive games. It uses the brute force analysis method for
tree searching, meaning that it analyses far more nodes per move than an
ordinary chess program such as GNU Chess or Crafty, but it cuts out all the
guesswork so that its analysis is always accurate to the depth specified.
