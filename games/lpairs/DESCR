LPairs is the classical memory game.
This means you have to find pairs of identical cards which will then
be removed. Your time and tries needed will be counted but there is no
highscore chart or limit to this. I wrote this game to improve my
memory a bit as I have some problems in remembering things.
Of course, LPairs provides a menu like all other Lgames to configure
graphics, sounds and gameplay (number of cards, preview of all cards
before game starts).
