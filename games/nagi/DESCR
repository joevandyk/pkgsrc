NAGI (New Adventure Game Interpreter) is a clone of Sierra's own
AGI which they created and used through the 80's to produce a whole
bunch of great adventure games like Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry
and Kings Quest. NAGI was created by disassembling the original AGI
executable and writing equivalent C code that would run under
SDL which is a free generic library for low-level access
to graphics and audio. It can read both v2 and v3 game data for the
PC.
