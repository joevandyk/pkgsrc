Genecys is, or will be, a Massively Multi-player Online RPG or MMORPG. The
intent of the Genecys project, is to design a completely free and open
source online RPG for all to play, run, or modify. On a higher level.. one
of the fundamental design goals of Genecys, is that it becomes a
completely dynamic environment. Each server will be completely unique, and
follow it's own progression of events. Maps will be generated randomly, at
server startup, as will towns and NPCs. NPCs will be AI controlled, and ha
ve their own lives in the game, and exist to interact with the players,
not just be slaughtered by them and re-pop.
