Xpuyopuyo is a Tetris-like puzzle game where you strive to match up four
"blobs" of the same color.  Each match gives you points, and also dumps gray
rocks on your opponent which are irritating and troublesome to get rid of.
Multiple matches at one time score more points, and result in more rocks
being dumped on the opponent (much to their dismay).  First person to fill
up their screen with puyopuyo blobs loses.
