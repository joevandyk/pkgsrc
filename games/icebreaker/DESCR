So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica.
You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to
Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world
domination.

In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg
into small chunks. You do this by melting lines in the ice with
Special High-Tech GNU Tools.

If a penguin hits a line in progress, however, it vanishes with a
loud noise, and you lose a life.

Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are
small enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of
more than that, you'll save on postage, thus earning you exponential
amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a. "score").

After you ship off one batch of penguins, it's time to move on to
the next. Each subsequent 'berg will have one more penguin, and
you'll have one more life. This will continue until you lose, or
until you exceed level one hundred or so, which Ain't Gonna Happen.

Of course, this is an urgent mission, so you'll be penalized if
you're slow -- every second or so, your score drops down by one.
