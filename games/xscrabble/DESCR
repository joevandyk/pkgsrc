This is a full multiplayer (1-4) implementation of the classic board
game, with computer players, and over 118,000 word dictionary (the
Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, edition 3, as used in
U.S. tournaments). This was a joint project, with Matthew Badham, who
implemented the back end routines. There is a high score table, a best
single goes list, a handy setup window, and load/save facilities.
