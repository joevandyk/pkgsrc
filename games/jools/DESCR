Jools is a graphical puzzle game in the tradition of Tetris.  It
is a clone of Bejeweled (TM), an excellent game which is currently
available only for Windows, Mac, and Palm/Pocket PC devices.  In
a nutshell, the goal is to swap adjacent jools (jewels) within a
grid, in order to create rows of three or more of a kind.  These
jools will then disappear, and more will fall to fill their places.
Jools features nifty 3D rendered graphics.
