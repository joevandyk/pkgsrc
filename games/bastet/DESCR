   "For people who enjoy swearing at their computer, Bastet (short for
    Bastard Tetris) is an attractive alternative to Microsoft Word."

Have you ever thought Tetris(R) was evil because it wouldn't send you
that straight "I" brick you needed in order to clear four rows at the
same time?  Well Tetris(R) probably isn't evil, but Bastet certainly is.
>:-)

Bastet stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based
Tetris(R) clone. Unlike normal Tetris(R), however, Bastet does not
choose your next brick at random.  Instead, Bastet uses a special
algorithm designed to choose the worst brick possible.  As you can
imagine, playing Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!
