A networked game for X11. Up to ten worms can battle it out over the network,
to attempt to cage one another in.  Very much like tron.  Excellent graphics,
works on 8, 16 and 24 bit displays.

To play, click on the "X" to set up your players, and click on the box
marked <none> to set up your controls, you may then type the key you wish
to use for left, and right.
