LTris is a very polished Tetris clone and highly configurable due to
its menu.

It offers you the well-known gametype Classic, a funny gametype
Figures (new figure each level, suddenly appearing tiles and lines)
and Multiplayer with up to three players either controlled by human or
CPU(!).

In fact, even if you don't like Tetris you should download this just
to see your CPU in action in mode Demo!
