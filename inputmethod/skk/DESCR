SKK is one of Japanese input methods on Emacs. SKK was designed and created in
1987 by Masahiko Sato(a professor of Kyoto University). We will expand SKK in
this openlab in accordance with the GPL.

SKK is an abbreviation of `Simple Kana to Kanji conversion program'. Some
people say SKK should be `simple' as its name indicates and should not be
complicated in both of its features and structure of files. The goal of this
openlab is that we can say, `SKK is still simple in its main features, but
optionally exandable and still fast!'
