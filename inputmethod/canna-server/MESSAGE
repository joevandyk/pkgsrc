If you want Canna server to boot automatically,

	1) Copy ${PREFIX}/${RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR}/canna to /etc/rc.d/.
	2) Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf.

		canna=YES	canna_flags="-u ${CANNA_USER}"

canna_flags="-u ${CANNA_USER}" is not required, but recommended.  Note
that our Canna package no longer uses setuid(2) to make the server run
as user "${CANNA_USER}", owing to the implementation of "-u" option (3.6
and above).  See cannaserver(1M).

Also note that by default cannaserver(1M) no longer allows connections
through tcp port 5680.  You need to explicitly specify the port by the
"-inet" option.
