Mummer is a system for aligning whole genome sequences. Using an efficient
data structure called a suffix tree, the system is able rapidly to align
sequences containing millions of nucleotides whether in complete or draft
form. MUMmer can also align incomplete genomes; it handles the 100s or 1000s
of contigs from a shotgun sequencing project with ease, and will align them to
another set of contigs or a genome using the NUCmer program included with the
system.
