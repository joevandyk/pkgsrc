A Sequence Cleanup Program.  Lucy is a utility that prepares raw DNA
sequence fragments for sequence assembly,possibly using the TIGR
Assembler.  The cleanup process includes quality assessment,
confidence reassurance, vector trimming and vector removal.  The
primary advantage of Lucy over other similar utilities is that it is a
fully integrated, stand alone program.
