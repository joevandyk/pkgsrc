Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Modeler) is a system for finding
genes in microbial DNA, especially the genomes of bacteria and archaea.
Glimmer uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the coding regions
and  distinguish them from noncoding DNA. The IMM approach uses a combination
of Markov models from 1st through 8th-order, weighting each model according to
its predictive power.
