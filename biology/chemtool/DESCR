Chemtool is a program for drawing organic molecules easily and store
them as a X bitmap file. It runs under the X Window System using the
GTK widget set.

Molecules can be exported in X bitmap format. Encapsulated postscript,
fig, or PicTeX formats are also possible if the fig2dev program from
the transfig package (pkgsrc/print/transfig/) is installed.
