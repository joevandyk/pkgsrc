HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for sensitive database
searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries. HMMER takes
multiple sequence alignment as input and builds statistical model
called "Hidden Markov Model" which can be used as a query into a
sequence database to find and/or align additional homologues of the
sequence family.
