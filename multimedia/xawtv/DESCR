xawtv is a set of utilities to manage the video4linux interface (and BSD's
bktr driver too).  The main component of the suite is xawtv itself, which
is a X11 application to watch the TV.

The package includes the following main utilities:
* xawtv: a nice X11 application for watching TV.
* v4lctl: a command line tool to set video4linux parameters.
* streamer: a command line tool for capturing still images and AVI videos
  (with sound).
* radio: a simple, curses-based radio app.
* webcam: captures images and uploads them with FTP to a Web-Server in an
  endless loop.
