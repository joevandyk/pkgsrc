MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices,
and non-x86 CPUs). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, VIVO, ASF/WMV,
QT/MOV, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ files, supported
by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD,
SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, and even DivX movies too. The another big feature
of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It works
with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but
you can use GGI and SDL (and this way all their drivers) and some
lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx, and Radeon) too!
Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can
enjoy movies in fullscreen. It also sports nice big antialiased
shaded subtitles (10 supported types) with european/ISO 8859-1,
2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean fonts, and
OSD.
