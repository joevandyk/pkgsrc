The Quasar DV codec (libdv) is a software codec for DV video, the encoding
format used by most digital camcorders, typically those that support
the IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. FireWire or i.Link) interface. libdv was developed
according to the official standards for DV video: IEC 61834 and SMPTE
314M.

This package provides playdv for displaying DV-encoded video data,
dubdv for inserting audio into a digital video stream, encodedv for
encoding a series of images to a digital video stream, and dvconnect
for capturing and sending raw DV streams using the Linux IEEE 1394
video1394 device.
