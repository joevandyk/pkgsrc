The MPEG4IP project provides a standards-based system for encoding,
streaming, and playing encoded audio, video and text. To achieve
this we've integrated a number of existing open source packages,
and created some original code to fill in the gaps.

Please note this project is intended for developers who are interested
in standards based audio and video, and Internet streaming. It is
not intended for end-users.
