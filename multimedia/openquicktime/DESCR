  OpenQuicktime aims to be a portable library for handling Apple's
QuickTime(TM) popular media files on Unix-like environments.  Its aim is
to provide encoding, authoring and editing support as well as video
playback.

  This library is based on an enhanced version of the Quicktime 4 Linux
library.  It features decoding and encoding QuickTime files, support for
standard audio and video codecs (including MP3 audio) and a plug-in support
so that non-open source codecs can be used with OpenQuicktime.

  OpenQuicktime could be used by any Unix players or encoders wanting to
support the Quicktime format.  OpenQuicktime is still young but is already
used by some applications.  The most promising application using
OpenQuicktime is GStreamer.
