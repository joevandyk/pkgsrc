GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of
media-handling components, ranging from simple mp3 playback to complex
audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

This package provides the dvdread plugin for GStreamer, which allows reading
of DVD disks.  You'll probably want to install the dvdnav plugin (from the
gst-plugins0.8-dvdnav package), too.
