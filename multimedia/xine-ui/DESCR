  This is the official, xlib-based xine frontend.  Xine is a free
multimedia player.  It plays back CDs, DVDs, and VCDs.  It also decodes
multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3 from local disk drives, and
displays multimedia streamed over the Internet.  It interprets many of the
most common multimedia formats available -- and some of the most uncommon
formats, too.
