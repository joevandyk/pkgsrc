This tool is used for people wanting to take sections out of MPEG2-PS
files without re-encoding the resulting frames.  The idea is to
write specific "Group of Pictures" (GOP) sections to a new MPEG2-PS
file.  These GOPs will decode correctly (in theory), and the gaps
won't be noticed.  I wrote this tool to edit commercials out of
MPEG2 files produced by my KFir MPEG2 capture card.  Using this
tool for anything else is really beyond the scope of its design.
