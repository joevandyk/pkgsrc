GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of
media-handling components, ranging from simple mp3 playback to complex
audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

This package provides the dvdnav plugin for GStreamer, which allows navigation
of menus contained in DVDs.  You'll probably want to install the dvdread plugin
(from the gst-plugins0.8-dvdread package), too.
