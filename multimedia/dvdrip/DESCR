dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely
known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source
tools. dvd::rip itself is licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic License.

	"And note: it's spelled dvd::rip, and nothing else."
