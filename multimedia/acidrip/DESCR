AcidRip is a Gtk2::Perl application for ripping and encoding DVD's. It
neatly wraps MPlayer and MEncoder, which I think is pretty handy, seeing
as MPlayer is by far the best bit of video playing kit around for *nix.
As well as creating a simple Graphical Interface for those scared of
getting down and dirty with MEncoders command line interface, It also
automates the process in a number of ways:

    * Parses DVD into contents tree
    * Finds longest title
    * Calculate video bitrate for given filesize
    * Finds black bands and crops them
    * Gives suggestions for improved performance
    * Other stuff!
