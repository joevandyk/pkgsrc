libnms lets you add multimedia streaming playback in your applications in a
quick and straightforward way. This software, derived from the experience
matured with NeMeSi is fully compliant with IETF's standards for real-time
streaming of multimedia contents over Internet. libnms implements RTSP -
Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RFC2326) and RTP/RTCP - Real-Time Transport
Protocol/RTP Control Protocol (RFC3550) supporting the RTP Profile for Audio
and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RFC3551).

Currently libnms is relatively stable API wise and the most enlighting
documentation are the example code and the partially doxygenized headers.
