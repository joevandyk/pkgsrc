ogmtools are a set of utilities for Ogg Media files (OGM) manipulation,
written by Moritz Bunkuns.

Ogg is a container format that can contains much more than a simple
Vorbis sound stream: notably, you can have a video stream, subtitles,
etc.

ogmtools are not meant to encode or decode anything, but will be used
complementary to mplayer/mencoder or any other media encoding utility.
ogmmerge will produce an OGM file from separated components, like an
audio track and a video track, and ogmdemux will have the inverse
behaviour.  ogmsplit will cut a file into several parts, and ogminfo
will print information about the file.  The last tool, dvdxchap is
used in combination with ogmmerge to add some special comments into
the resulting OGM file to provide chaptering with the player that
support it (the OggDS Windows filter takes advantage of that).
