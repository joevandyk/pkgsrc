XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work
with TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML.
The idea is to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from
the frontend (displaying them for the user), and to implement useful
operations like picking out your favourite programmes as filters
that read and write XML documents.
