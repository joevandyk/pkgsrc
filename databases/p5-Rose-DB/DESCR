Rose::DB is a wrapper and abstraction layer for DBI-related
functionality. A Rose::DB object "has a" DBI object; it is not a
subclass of DBI.

Tip: Are you looking for an object-relational mapper (ORM)? If so,
please see the Rose::DB::Object module. Rose::DB::Object is an ORM
that uses this module to manage its database connections. Rose::DB
alone is simply a data source abstraction layer; it is not an ORM.
