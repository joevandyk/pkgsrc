JDB is package of commands for manipulating flat-ASCII databases from
shell scripts.  JDB is useful to process medium amounts of data (with
very little data you'd do it by hand, with megabytes you might want a
real database).  JDB is very good at doing things like:

	- extracting measurements from experimental output
	- re-examining data to address different hypotheses
        - joining data from different experiments
	- eliminating/detecting outliers
	- computing statistics on data (mean, confidence intervals,
		correlations, histograms)
	- reformatting data for graphing programs
