MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging)

MARC.pm is a Perl 5 module for reading in, manipulating, and outputting
bibliographic records in the USMARC format.  It handles conversions
from MARC into ASCII (text),  Library of Congress MARCMaker, HTML,
and ISBD. Input from MARCMaker format is also supported. Individual
records, fields, indicators, and subfields can be created, modified, and
deleted. It can extract URLs from the 856 field into HTML.

MARC.pm can handle both single and batches of MARC records. The limit on
the number of records in a batch is determined by the memory capacity of
the machine you are running. If memory is an issue for you MARC.pm will
allow you to read in records from a batch gradually. MARC.pm also includes
a variety of tools for searching, removing, and even creating records from
scratch.
