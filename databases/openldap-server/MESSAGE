Note to users who have been running slapd and/or slurpd as root before:

As both slapd and slurpd now run unprivileged by default (as ${SLAPD_USER}:${LDAP_GROUP}
and ${SLURPD_USER}:${LDAP_GROUP}, respectively), you'll have to adapt some permissions:

  ${CHOWN} -R ${SLAPD_USER}:${LDAP_GROUP} ${OPENLDAP_VARDIR}/openldap-data/*
  ${CHOWN} -R ${SLURPD_USER}:${LDAP_GROUP} ${OPENLDAP_VARDIR}/openldap-slurp/*
  ${CHOWN} :${LDAP_GROUP} ${OPENLDAP_ETCDIR}/slapd.conf
  ${CHMOD} 640 ${OPENLDAP_ETCDIR}/slapd.conf

You may have to repeat the first command after running administrative tools
such as slapadd and slapindex as root.
