DBD::PgPP is a Pure Perl client interface for the PostgreSQL database.
This module implements network protocol between server and client of
PostgreSQL, thus you don't need external PostgreSQL client library like
libpq for this module to work. It means this module enables
you to connect to PostgreSQL server from some operation systems
which PostgreSQL is not ported. How nifty!
