The Tsearch2 contrib module contains an implementation of a new data
type tsvector - a searchable data type with indexed access. In a
nutshell, tsvector is a set of unique words along with their
positional information in the document, organized in a special
structure optimized for fast access and lookup. This data type can
be used as backend for efficient full text search engines.
