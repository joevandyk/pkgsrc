The perl-ldap distribution is a collection of perl modules which
provide an object orientated interface to LDAP servers.

The perl-ldap distribution has several advantages:

  * By using the perl object interface the perl-ldap modules provide
    programmers with an interface which allows complex searches of
    LDAP directories with only a small amount of code.

  * All the perl-ldap modules are written entirely in perl, which
    means that the library is truly cross-platform compatible.  No C
    or XS extension are used so no C compiler is needed to install
    the modules.
