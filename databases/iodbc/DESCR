iODBC (Independent Open Database Connectivity) driver manager
is compatible with ODBC 3.x specification and performs exactly
same jobs of ODBC 3.x driver manager(i.e. driver loading,
Parameters and function sequence checking, driver's function
Invoking, etc.). Any ODBC driver works with ODBC 3.0 driver
Manager will also work with iODBC driver manager and vice versa.

Applications (using ODBC function calls) linked with
iODBC driver manager will be able to simultaneously access
different type of data sources within one process through
suitable iODBC drivers.
