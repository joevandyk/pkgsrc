This module helps abstract the process of working with complex
schemas of relational SQL database tables. As with DBI, it lets
you work with data a row at a time, but gives you the extra ability
to, with a single method call, reach across and grab rows of related
data from tables located elsewhere in your database, without having
to construct an SQL join clause yourself. The 'distance' from the
originating table to the related one can be arbitrarily long, so
long as they are related in some way -- i.e., could both return
data through a single (though perhaps quite lengthy) SQL query.
