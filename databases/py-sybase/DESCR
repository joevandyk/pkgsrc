This Sybase module provides a Python interface to the Sybase relational
database system. The Sybase package supports all of the Python Database API,
version 2.0 with extensions.

This pkgsrc module (pysybase) is currently configured to use the FreeTDS
client libraries instead of the Sybase client libraries.
