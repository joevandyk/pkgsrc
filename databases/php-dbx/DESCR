PHP is a programming language designed to be embedded into web pages.

The dbx module is a database abstraction layer (db 'X', where 'X'
is a supported database). The dbx functions allow you to access
all supported databases using a single calling convention. The
dbx-functions themselves do not interface directly to the databases,
but interface to the modules that are used to support these databases.

Supported databases include MSSQL, MySQL, ODBC, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
