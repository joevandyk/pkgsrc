Rose::DB::Object is a base class for objects that encapsulate a
single row in a database table. It provides the following functions:

 * Create a row in the database by saving a newly constructed object.
 * Initialize an object by loading a row from the database.
 * Update a row by saving a modified object back to the database.
 * Delete a row from the database.
 * Fetch an object referred to by a foreign key in the current object.
   (i.e., "one to one" and "many to one" relationships.)
 * Fetch multiple objects that refer to the current object, either directly
   through foreign keys or indirectly through a mapping table. (i.e., "one
   to many" and "many to many" relationships.)
 * Load an object along with "foreign objects" that are related through any
   of the supported relationship types.
