SQLite is a small fast embedded SQL database engine.

DBD::SQLite2 embeds that database engine into a DBD driver, so
if you want a relational database for your project, but don't
want to install a large RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL,
then DBD::SQLite2 may be just what you need.

Note: DBD::SQLite2 is the old version of DBD::SQLite, and embeds
version 2.x.x of the sqlite library. The current version of
DBD::SQLite embeds version 3 or possibly later.
This release is designed to allow to have both versions installed
on the same system.
