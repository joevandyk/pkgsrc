Sqsh (pronounced skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced s-q-shell), it
is intended as a replacement for the venerable 'isql' program supplied
by Sybase.  It came about due to years of frustration of trying to do
real work with a program that was never meant to perform real work.

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt, it is intended to provide much of
the functionality provided by a good shell, such as variables,
redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job control, history, command
completion, and dynamic configuration.  Also, as a by-product of the
design, it is remarkably easy to extend and add functionality.
