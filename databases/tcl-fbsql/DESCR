This Tcl extension provides access to MySQL database servers using simple Tcl
commands.

I wrote this extension because my main Tcl application (fully integrated
accounting system) was requiring more flexibility than the current extensions
allowed, I also wanted to increase performance (I had too many wrapper
programs for performing basic queries).
