While pytable does not have an explicit dependency, it will not work
unless a supported DB-API 2.0 adapter is installed.  The following
packages are known to work.  Please see the web site at http://pytable.sf.net/
for the full list of supported adapters.

 - databases/py-postgresql
 - databases/py-PgSQL
