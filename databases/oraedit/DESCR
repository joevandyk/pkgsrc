oraedit is simple wrapper for editing Oracle stored functions,
procedures, packages, types and views. Requires only Oracle sqlplus
binary, or rsh/ssh connection to computer with one. Any local editor
can be used with oraedit, including vim or pico.

Documentation is currently not present, but hopefully the configuration
and usage is reasoably straighforward.
