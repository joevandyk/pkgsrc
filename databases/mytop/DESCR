mytop was inspired by the system monitoring tool top. I routinely use top on
Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. You are likely to notice features from each of
them here.

mytop will connect to a MySQL server and periodically run the SHOW PROCESSLIST
and SHOW STATUS commands and attempt to summarize the information from them
in a useful format.
