Many programs and desktops use the MIME system to represent the types of
files.  Frequently, it is necessary to work out the correct MIME type for
a file.  This is generally done by examining the file's name or contents,
and looking up the correct MIME type in a database.

For interoperability, it is useful for different programs to use the same
database so that different programs agree on the type of a file, and new
rules for determining the type apply to all programs.

This package contains the core database of common types and the
update-mime-database command used to extend it.
