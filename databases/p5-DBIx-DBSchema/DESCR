This module implements an OO-interface to database schemas.  Using
this module, you can create a database schema with an OO Perl
interface.  You can read the schema from an existing database.
You can save the schema to disk and restore it from different
process.  Most importantly, DBIx::DBSchema can write SQL CREATE
statements for different databases from a single source.

Currently supported databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and
Sybase.  DBIx::DBSchema will attempt to use generic SQL syntax for
other databases.  Assistance adding support for other databases is
welcomed.
