Apache::AuthDBI.pm and Apache::DBI.pm are supposed to be used with
the Apache server together with an embedded perl interpreter like
mod_perl. They provide support for basic authentication and
authorization as well as support for persistent database connections
via Perl's Database Independent Interface (DBI).
