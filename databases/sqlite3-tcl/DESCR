SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. Programs
that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without
running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone
command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an
SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite
library.

SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server.
SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and
from the database files on disk.

This package provides the TCL bindings for the SQLite C library.
