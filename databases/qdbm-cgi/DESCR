QDBM is an embeded database library compatible with GDBM and NDBM.  It
features hash database and B+ tree database and is developed referring
to GDBM for the purpose of the following three points: higher
processing speed, smaller size of a database file, and simpler API.

This package provides CGI scripts for QDBM.
