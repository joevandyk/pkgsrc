psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
(just like pygresql and popy.) It was written from scratch with the aim of
being very small and fast, and stable as a rock. The main advantages of
psycopg are that it supports (well... *will* support) the full Python
DBAPI-2.0 and being thread safe at level 2.

psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
Every open Python connection keeps a pool of real (UNIX or TCP/IP) connections
to the database. Every time a new cursor is created, a new connection does not
need to be opened; instead one of the unused connections from the pool is
used. That makes psycopg very fast in typical client-server applications that
create a servicing thread every time a client request arrives.

This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to provide
new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other
sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of
being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
