This perl package uses perl5 objects to make it easy for manipulating
spreadsheet data among disk files, database, and Web publishing.

A table object contains a header and a two-dimensional array of scalars.
Three class methods Data::Table::fromCSV, Data::Table::fromTSV, and
Data::Table::fromSQL allow users to create a table object from a CSV/TSV
file or a database SQL selection in a snap.
