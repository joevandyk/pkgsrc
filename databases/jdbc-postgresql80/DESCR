This is a pure Java (Type IV) JDBC driver for the PostgreSQL
database.  It allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL
database using standard, database independent Java code.

The driver provides a reasonably complete implementation of the
JDBC 3 specification in addition to some PostgreSQL specific
extensions.
