pgAdmin III is the most popular and feature rich Open Source administration and
development platform for PostgreSQL, the most advanced Open Source database in
the world. The application may be used on BSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX and
Windows platforms to manage PostgreSQL 7.3 and above running on any platform,
as well as commercial versions of PostgreSQL such as Pervasive Postgres,
EnterpriseDB, Mammoth PostgreSQL and SRA PowerGres.

pgAdmin III is designed to answer the needs of all users, from writing simple
SQL queries to developing complex databases. The graphical interface supports
all PostgreSQL features and makes administration easy. The application also
includes a syntax highlighting SQL editor, a server-side code editor, an
SQL/batch/shell job scheduling agent, support for the Slony-I replication
engine and much more. Server connection may be made using TCP/IP or Unix Domain
Sockets (on *nix platforms), and may be SSL encrypted for security. No
additional drivers are required to communicate with the database server.
