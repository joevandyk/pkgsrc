The sources accompanying this notice -- sdbm -- constitute the first
public release (Dec.  1990) of a complete clone of the Berkeley UN*X ndbm
library.  The sdbm library is meant to clone the proven functionality of
ndbm as closely as possible, including a few improvements.  It is
practical, easy to understand, and compatible.  The sdbm library is not
derived from any licensed, proprietary or copyrighted software.

The sdbm programming interface is totally compatible with ndbm and
includes a slight improvement in database initialization.  It is also
expected to be binary-compatible under most UN*X versions that support the
ndbm library.
