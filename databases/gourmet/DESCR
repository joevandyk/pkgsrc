Gourmet Recipe Manager is a manager, editor, and organizer for
recipes. It currently has support for MealMaster(tm) and
MasterCook(tm) import, including 1 and 2 column MealMaster recipes and
plain text and XML MasterCook(tm). It can also export and import an XML
format of its own (the DTD is included here for your interest) which I
developed for an earlier recipe program in emacs-lisp. It also allows
you to export recipes as MealMaster(tm), HTML, RTF or Plain Text.
