sybperl includes four modules: Sybase::DBlib, Sybase::CTlib,
Sybase::BCP and Sybase::Sybperl. The first two implement a thin
wrapper around the Sybase DB-Library and Client Library APIs,
respectively. Sybase::BCP is a specialty module aimed at doing
Bulk-Copy operations, and Sybase::Sybperl is a compatibility module
with sybperl 1.xx (i.e. with the perl 4.x version).

The sybperl modules are thin wrappers around the Sybase APIs. This is
both good and bad. It's good because you have greater control, and
because the API is (obviously) close to the way the server and the
protocol work. It's bad in that it's a proprietary API, and that it is
somewhat verbose.
