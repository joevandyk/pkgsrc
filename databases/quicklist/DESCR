QuickList is a free (GPL) gtk+ program for any un*x system that allows
novice and experienced users to keep track of "things" without any help
from a system administrator. "Things" can be anything, including (but
certainly not limited to!) bug lists, phone lists, restaurants, team
members, calendars, cool urls, checkbooks, fishing holes, CDs, bunjee
jumping cool sites, etc. It is completely flexible.

QuickList lists "things" in column format, much as they would appear in a
spreadsheet. Quicklist can sort lists of "things," search from them and
generate printable reports from them.

The native (.qlf) file format is non-relational, non-SQL. Comma and tab
delimited files can be imported and exported. In addition, html files
can be exported for publishing to the World Wide Web.

If you liked the Appleworks or Microsoft Works databases, you will like
QuickList.
