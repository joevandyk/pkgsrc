This is a powerful frontend for the MiniSQL or MySQL database
engines, that allows the user to search the database through easy
to use searchforms, select databases and tables from a menu, modify
records just by clicking them in a browser and much more.  Xsqlmenu
supports having multiple tablewindows open at the same time (even
from different databases !).  Also free SQL SELECT statements are
allowed (although they have a few restrictions to avoid confusion).
