GNATS was designed as a tool for software maintainers. It consists of several
utilities which, when used in concert, formulate and administer a database of
Problem Reports grouped by site-defined problem categories. It allows a
support organization to keep track of problems (hence the term Problem Report)
in an organized fashion. Essentially, GNATS acts as an active archive for
field-separated textual data.
