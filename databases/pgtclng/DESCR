TCL interface to PostgreSQL.

This is one of three different ones that are available. This is the
"standard version" evolved from the interfaces/libpgtcl which used to
be included with the PostgreSQL distribution. There is also a pgintcl
interface, which is entirely native TCL and does not rely on libpq, and
pgtcl, which is the "current generation" version of pgtclng.
