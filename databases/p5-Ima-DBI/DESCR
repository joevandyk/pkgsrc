Ima::DBI attempts to organize and facilitate caching and more
efficient use of database connections and statement handles.

One of the things I always found annoying about writing large
programs with DBI was making sure that I didn't have duplicate
database handles open.  I was also annoyed by the somewhat wasteful
nature of the prepare/execute/finish route I'd tend to go through
in my subroutines.  The new DBI->connect_cached and DBI->prepare_cached
helped alot, but I still had to throw around global datasource,
username and password information.

So, after a while I grew a small library of DBI helper routines
and techniques.  Ima::DBI is the culmination of all this, put into
a nice(?), clean(?) class to be inherited from.
