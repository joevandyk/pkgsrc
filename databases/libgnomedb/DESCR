  Libgnomedb provides a rich set of UI features targeted to the development
of data access applications.  Using libgnomedb your GTK2/GNOME2 application
data access needs will be covered.  You'll have available, nicely
integrated with the rest of the GNOME libraries, a whole set of data-bound
widgets.
