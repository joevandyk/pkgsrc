The unixODBC project provides UNIX applications with the same ODBC 3.51
API and facilities available under MS Windows. It provides a Driver Manager
that supports the full ODBC API and performs the ODBC 3 to ODBC 2
translations with UNICODE to ANSI conversion.  It also includes a collection
of ODBC drivers including a simple text-based driver, an NNTP driver, a
Postgres driver and others, and a selection of templates and libraries that
to aid in the construction of ODBC drivers. It works with MySQL, Postgres,
StarOffice, Applixware, iHTML, PHP, Perl DBD::ODBC, Paradox 9, and many
other applications and drivers.  Connection pooling is also provided to
increase performance with applications such as PHP.
