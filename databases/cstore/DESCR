C-Store is a read-optimized relational DBMS that contrasts sharply
with most current systems, which are write-optimized.  Among the many
differences in its design are:

+ storage of data by column rather than by row,

+ careful coding and packing of objects into storage including main
memory during query processing,

+ storing an overlapping collection of column-oriented projections,
rather than the current fare of tables and indexes,

+ a non-traditional implementation of transactions which includes high
availability and snapshot isolation for read-only transactions,

+ and the extensive use of bitmap indexes to complement B-tree
structures.
