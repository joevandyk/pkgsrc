  Edb is a database abstraction layer to Berkeley Databases.  Edb contains
the source for DB 2.7.7, thus freezing the database format on disk, making
sure it will never become incompatible.  Edb wraps this with a convenience
and optimization API layer, making database access easy, fast and
consistent. It handles typing of information in the database and much
more.  Edb is *VERY* fast and all of Enlightenment 17 configuration
management is built on top of it - every configuration file is a database
- including Ebits files.
