SQLite is a public domain RDBMS database engine.

Rather than ask you to install SQLite first, because SQLite is
public domain, DBD::SQLite includes the entire thing in the
distribution. So in order to get a fast transaction capable RDBMS
working for your perl project you simply have to install this module,
and nothing else.
