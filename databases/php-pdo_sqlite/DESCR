PHP is a programming language designed to be embedded into web pages.

This extension provides an SQLite v3 driver for PDO.  SQLite V3 is
NOT compatible with the bundled SQLite 2 in PHP 5, but is a
significant step forwards, featuring complete utf-8 support, native
support for blobs, native support for prepared statements with
bound parameters and improved concurrency.
