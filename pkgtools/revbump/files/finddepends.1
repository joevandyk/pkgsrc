.Sh NAME
.Nm finddepends
.Nd find direct dependencies of a package
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Ar pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers that helps finding packages
affected by a recursive PKGREVISION bump.
Given a
.Ar pattern
on the command line, it will recursively find all buildlink3.mk files
that include it, and then find all Makefiles that include any of the
buildlink3.mk files.
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
See
.Xr revbump 1
for an example of a complete recursive PKGREVISION bump.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev PKGSRCDIR
pkgsrc root directory.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl finddepends security/libtasn1
.Pp
would first output all buildlink3.mk files that include
security/libtasn1, and then all Makefiles and options.mk files that
include any of the found buildlink3.mk files.
