.Sh NAME
.Nm revbump
.Nd tool to help bump PKGREVISIONs automatically
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Op cat1/pkg1 ... catN/pkgN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers that simplifies bumping
PKGREVISIONs automatically.
Given a package (in
.Ar category/package
format) on the command line or stdin, it will try to increase
the PKGREVISION for that package automatically.
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
.Nm
reports successful updates on stdout, and prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl revbump devel/gmake x11/glib2
.Pp
would bump the PKGREVISIONs of gmake and glib2, as would
.Bd -literal -offset indent
revbump \*[Lt]\*[Lt] EOF
devel/gmake
x11/glib2
EOF
.Ed
.Pp
The complete procedure for a recursive dependency bump for
the openssl package using
.Nm
and
.Xr blbump 1
would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/pkgsrc
finddepends security/openssl \*[Gt] allbump
grep buildlink3.mk allbump | sed 's/.buildlink3.mk//' \*[Gt] bl3bump
grep -v buildlink3.mk allbump | sed 's/.Makefile$//' \*[Gt] makebump
revbump \*[Lt] makebump \*[Gt] makebump.manual
[handle the PKGREVISION bumps in makebump.manual manually;
 this will include any Makefile.common files - the files that include
 them will currently need to be found manually]
blbump \*[Lt] bl3bump \*[Gt] bl3bump.manual
[handle the *ABI_DEPENDS* bumps in bl3bump.manual manually]
cvs diff `cat allbump`
[look for PYPKGPREFIX -\*[Gt] py22 or py23pth expansions
 in buildlink files and any unrelated diffs you have in your
 local tree, and fix them]
lintpkgsrc -d
[fix broken dependencies noted by this (usually meta-pkg/kde3,
  subversion, nessus)]
cvs diff `cat allbump`
cvs commit `cat allbump`
rm allbump bl3bump* makebump*
