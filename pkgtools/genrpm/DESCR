This package installs a script called genrpm, which is used to
generate a Redhat Package Manager (RPM) package from an installed
pkgsrc package.  It does this by generating a spec file, and using
that to identify the components of the RPM and package them.

If a pkgsrc tree is present on the system, a source RPM (or srpm)
can also be generated. This will include the distfile, any pkgsrc
patches, and the files used to accomplish the pkgsrc packaging.
