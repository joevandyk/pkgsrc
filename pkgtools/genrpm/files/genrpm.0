     The ggeennrrppmm program takes an installed pkgsrc package and creates a Redhat
     Package Manager package from that, optionally creating an RPM-style src
     RPM in addition.  If the --vv option is specified, ggeennrrppmm will carry out
     its work in a verbose manner (the rpm utility is already a fairly verbose
     utility).

     Package version extension will be done automatically by ggeennrrppmm so that
     rpm packages do not need to know the individual version numbers of pkgsrc
     packages.

     An optional source rpm package can also be created by using the --ss flag.
