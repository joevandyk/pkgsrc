.Sh NAME
.Nm digest
.Nd calculate message digests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar algorithm
.Op file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility calculates message digests of files or,
if no file is specified, standard input.
The list of possible algorithms is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It md5
the
.Xr md5 3
algorithm will be used.
.It rmd160
the
.Xr rmd160 3
algorithm will be used.
.It sha1
the
.Xr sha1 3
algorithm will be used.
.It sha256
the
sha256
algorithm will be used.
.It sha384
the
sha384
algorithm will be used.
.It sha512
the
sha512
algorithm will be used.
.It tiger
the
tiger
algorithm will be used.
.It whirlpool
the
whirlpool
algorithm will be used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is a simple wrapper for the various different
algorithm implementations, which are located in the standard
C library, and was designed to be scalable as new message digest
algorithms are developed.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .

.Nm
utility was written by
