     rrccoorrddeerr is designed to print out a dependency ordering of a set of inter-
     dependent files.  Typically it is used to find an execution sequence for
     a set of shell scripts in which certain files must be executed before
     others.

     Each file passed to rrccoorrddeerr should be annotated with special lines (which
     look like comments to the shell) which indicate the dependencies the
     files have upon certain points in the sequence, known as ``conditions'',
     and which indicate, for each file, which ``conditions'' may be expected
     to be filled by that file.

     Within each file, a block containing a series of ``REQUIRE'',
     ``PROVIDE'', ``BEFORE'' and ``KEYWORD'' lines should appear.  The format
     of the lines is rigid.  Each line must begin with a single ``#'', fol-
     lowed by a single space, followed by ``PROVIDE:'', ``REQUIRE:'',
     ``BEFORE:'', or ``KEYWORD:''.  No deviation is permitted.  Each depen-
     dency line is then followed by a series of conditions, separated by
     whitespace.  Multiple ``PROVIDE'', ``REQUIRE'', ``BEFORE'' and
     ``KEYWORD'' lines may appear, but all such lines must appear in a
     sequence without any intervening lines, as once a line that does not fol-
     low the format is reached, parsing stops.

     The options are as follows:

     --kk      Add the specified keyword to the ``keep list''.  If any --kk option
             is given, only those files containing the matching keyword are
             listed.

     --ss      Add the specified keyword to the ``skip list''.  If any --ss option
             is given, files containing the matching keyword are not listed.

      An example block follows:

           # REQUIRE: networking syslog
           # REQUIRE: usr
           # PROVIDE: dns nscd

     This block states that the file in which it appears depends upon the
     ``networking'', ``syslog'', and ``usr'' conditions, and provides the
     ``dns'' and ``nscd'' conditions.

     A file may contain zero ``PROVIDE'' lines, in which case it provides no
     conditions, and may contain zero ``REQUIRE'' lines, in which case it has
     no dependencies.  A file containing no ``PROVIDE'', ``REQUIRE'', or
     ``BEFORE'' lines may be output at an arbitrary position in the dependency
     ordering.

     There must be at least one file with no dependencies in the set of argu-
     ments passed to rrccoorrddeerr in order for it to find a starting place in the
     dependency ordering.

     rrccoorrddeerr may print one of the following error messages and exit with a
     non-zero status if it encounters an error while processing the file list.

     line corresponding to a condition present in a ``REQUIRE'' line in
     another file.
