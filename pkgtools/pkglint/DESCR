pkglint is for pkgsrc packages what lint(1) is for C files. It checks
for various things that the used languages cannot detect, for example
application-specific restrictions on certain variables.

Before importing a new package or making changes to an existing package,
pkglint should be run in the package's directory to check for common
errors.
