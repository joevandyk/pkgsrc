<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>&pkglint; is a static analysis tool for pkgsrc packages.
	It finds many errors and problematic issues in those packages.
	Starting in June 2004, &pkglint; has evolved into a powerful
	tool that gives precise warnings wherever possible. With that
	power comes much additional complexity, which cannot be
	understood from reading the source code alone. This document
	provides the necessary background information to understand what
	the actual code does and why it is done this way.</para>
