To-Do List for cdpack
---------------------


- extract COMMENT and DESCR to generate a browseable index of all the 
  packages on the CD set.  This would be similar to the README.html's
  in pkgsrc, but with some modifications.   The changes would be to
  list which CD certain pkgs are on.  Also, if a DEPENDS is not on the
  CD set (due to redistribution restrictions for example), perhaps
  list that so the user knows s/he must install the restricted DEPENDS
  by hand first.

- come up with some sort of install tool around pkg_add.  Perhaps this 
  could be done using SUSHI.  The idea would be to let the user browse
  the selection of packages, select some subset of them and then do
  a batch install.

- add a -pipe option to pipe the output of mkisofs directly to 
  cdrecord (or other program) to allow direct writing to CD avoiding
  the need for a potentially large amount of disk space for the
  generated images.

- add an option to go through pkgsrc and find all the packages
  which can't be packaged (NO_PACKAGE or INTERACTIVE) and copy
  the distfiles into a single directory.  This way you can create
  a CD set where you include distfiles for the packages which
  couldn't be made into binary pkgs.

- add an options that would search in multiple directories for
  binary packages and only pick the most recent versions of any
  given package.  If an older version is required by some other
  pkg, also pick that one up too.
