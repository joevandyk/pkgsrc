cdpack is a small utility for creating ISO 9660 images for
a multi-CD/DVD binary package collection.  The utility creates
ISO 9660 images for all the binary packages in a specified
directory.

A choice of two algorithms is available for how the packages
are grouped.  The "no duplication" algorithm arranges the
packages so any package on CD/DVD number `n' will have all of
its dependencies on CD/DVD numbers 1 through `n'.

The "no inter-CD/DVD depends" algorithm will place certain
packages on more than one CD/DVD to ensure that each CD/DVD is
self contained (all package dependencies are satisfied within
the single CD/DVD).
