DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The lliinnkkffaarrmm command is used to manage a "linkfarm", a directory tree of
     symbolic links in _t_a_r_g_e_t to the files in the _p_a_c_k_a_g_e sub-directory of
     _s_t_o_w_d_i_r.  The default action is to create a linkfarm to a package.

     The following command-line options are supported:

     --cc      Check whether a package contains a linkfarm in _t_a_r_g_e_t.  If
             _p_a_c_k_a_g_e has no symbolic links in _t_a_r_g_e_t that correspond to its
             files, then return 0, otherwise return 1.

     --DD      Delete the linkfarm for _p_a_c_k_a_g_e.

     --dd _s_t_o_w_d_i_r
             Set _s_t_o_w_d_i_r as the directory in which _p_a_c_k_a_g_e can be found.  The
             default _s_t_o_w_d_i_r is the _p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s sub-directory in the default
             _t_a_r_g_e_t directory.

     --nn      Don't actually execute the commands for removing and creating the
             symbolic links and directories.

     --RR      Delete and re-create the linkfarm for _p_a_c_k_a_g_e.

     --ss _s_u_b_d_i_r
             The root of the package hierarchy for the linkfarm is the _s_u_b_d_i_r
             sub-directory in the package.  By default, assume the root of the
             package hierarchy is simply the _p_a_c_k_a_g_e directory.

     --tt _t_a_r_g_e_t
             Set _t_a_r_g_e_t as the directory in which to create and delete the
             linkfarm for _p_a_c_k_a_g_e.  The default _t_a_r_g_e_t directory is _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g
             but may be overridden by the LOCALBASE environment variable.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.  Specifying --vv multiple times increases
             the level of verbosity.

     LOCALBASE
             The standard packages directory, _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g, can be overridden by
             specifying an alternative directory in the LOCALBASE environment
             variable.  This affects the default _t_a_r_g_e_t and _s_t_o_w_d_i_r directo-
             ries.

     PLIST_IGNORE_FILES
             This can be used to specify files in _p_a_c_k_a_g_e that should ignored
             when creating and deleting symbolic links in _t_a_r_g_e_t.
             PLIST_IGNORE_FILES is a space-separated list of shell glob pat-
             terns that match files relative to the _p_a_c_k_a_g_e directory, and it
             defaults to "info/dir *[~#] *.OLD *.orig *,v".
