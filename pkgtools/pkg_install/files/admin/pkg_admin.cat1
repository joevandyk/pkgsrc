DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This command performs various administrative tasks around the NetBSD
     Packages System.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following command-line options are supported:

     --bb      Print only the basenames when matching package names for llssaallll
             and llssbbeesstt.

     --dd _l_s_d_i_r
             Set _l_s_d_i_r as the path to the directory in which to find matching
             package names for llssaallll and llssbbeesstt.

     --KK _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r
             Set _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r as the package database directory.  If this option
             isn't specified, then the package database directory is taken
             from the value of the environment variable PKG_DBDIR if it's set,
             otherwise it defaults to _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     --qq      Perform checks in a quiet manner.  In normal operation, ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn
             prints a `.' to standard output to indicate progress.  This
             option suppresses this progress indicator.

     --SS      Set the shell glob pattern for package suffixes when matching
             package names for llssaallll and llssbbeesstt to be the null suffix.

     --ss _s_f_x___p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Set the shell glob pattern for package suffixes when matching
             package names for llssaallll and llssbbeesstt.  The default pattern is
             ".t[bg]z".

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     The following commands are supported:

     aadddd _p_k_g _._._.
             For each listed package, write the absolute pathnames of the
             files listed in its _+_C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S file together with the package they
             belong to into the package database.  This should be used only by
             pkg_view(1).

     cchheecckk [_p_k_g _._._.]
             Use this command to check the files belonging to some or all of
             the packages installed on the local machine against the checksum
             which was recorded in the _+_C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S files at package installation
             time.  Symbolic links also have their integrity checked against
             the recorded value at package installation time.  If no addi-
             tional argument is given, the files of all installed packages are
             checked, else only the named packages will be checked (wildcards
             can be used here, see pkg_info(1)).

             The packages' _+_C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S files will be parsed and the checksum
             will be checked for every file found.  A warning message is
             printed if the expected checksum differs from the checksum of the
             file on disk.  Symbolic links are also checked, ensuring that the
             targets on disk are the same as the contents recorded at package
             installation time.

     ddeelleettee _p_k_g _._._.
             For each listed package, remove all file entries in the package
             database that belong to the package.  This should be used only by
             pkg_view(1).

     dduummpp    Dump the contents of the package database, similar to ppkkgg__iinnffoo
             --FF.  Columns are printed for the keyfield used in the pkgdb - the
             filename -, and the data field - the package the file belongs to.

     llssaallll _/_d_i_r_/_p_k_g_p_a_t_t_e_r_n

     llssbbeesstt _/_d_i_r_/_p_k_g_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             List all/best package matching pattern in the given directory
             _/_d_i_r.  If the --dd flag is given, then that directory path over-
             rides _/_d_i_r.  Can be used to work around limitations of /bin/sh
             and other filename globbing mechanisms.  This option implements
             matching of pkg-wildcards against arbitrary files and directo-
             ries, useful mainly in the build system itself.  See pkg_info(1)
             for a description of the pattern.

             Example:

             yui# cd /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/
             yui# ls unzip*
             unzip-5.40.tgz  unzip-5.41.tgz
             yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip*'
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
             yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip>=5.40'
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
             yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip>=5.41'
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
             yui# pkg_admin lsbest 'unzip>=5.40'
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
             yui# pkg_admin lsall /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/'{mit,unproven}-pthread*'
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/mit-pthreads-1.60b6.tgz
             /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unproven-pthreads-0.15.tgz

     ppmmaattcchh _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _p_k_g
             Returns true if _p_k_g matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, otherwise returns false.

     rreebbuuiilldd
             Rebuild the package database mapping from scratch, scanning sub-
             directories in _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g for _+_C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S files, parsing them and
             writing the resulting absolute pathnames together with the pack-
             age they belong to into the package database.

             This option is intended to be used for upgrading from non-pkgdb-
             pkg_* tools to pkgdb-pkg_* tools, further manipulation of the
             pkgdb will be done by pkg_add(1), pkg_delete(1), and
             pkg_create(1).

             Needs to be run as root.

     rreebbuuiilldd--ttrreeee
             Rebuild the +REQUIRED_BY files from scratch by reresolving all
             dependencies.

             This option is intended to be used for fixing inconsistencies
             between the records of depending and depended-on packages, such
             as can arise by the use of ppkkgg__ddeelleettee --ff.

     sseett _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_=_v_a_l_u_e _p_k_g _._._.
             Set variable with information about the installed package.  Use
             uunnsseett to remove a variable.

             Packages that are not installed directly by the user but pulled
             in as dependencies are marked by setting ``automatic=YES''.

     uunnsseett _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _p_k_g _._._.
             Remove an installation variable.

     PKG_DBDIR
             If the --KK flag isn't given, then PKG_DBDIR is the location of the
             package database directory.  The default package database direc-
             tory is _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.
