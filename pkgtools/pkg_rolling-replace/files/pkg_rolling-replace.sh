# REVIEW NOTATION LEGEND
#   XXX marks things that are broken/kludgy
#   TODO marks things that need to be done
#   FIXED marks items fixed, needs review and deletion of FIXED comment

# Items to be completed for initial release:

# TODO: move bulk of help into a real man page.

# Items for future work (some imply changes in pkgsrc, not necessarily here)
#
#   Make a pass over all packages for build depends, and rememeber
# which packages have been so checked.  Check newly unsafe packages.
# The current lazy evaluation can perhaps fail to do things in the
# right order.  Alternatively, explain why the current scheme is safe
# and preferred.
#
#   Consider expansion to update via binary packages.  This raises
# interesting questions about ABIs and binary builds
#
#   Deal with conflicts in a smarter way, perhaps more automatically.
# This is hard because just removing packages is not ok.
#
#   Handle foo being split into foo and foo-share.  Now, make replace
# of foo pulls in foo-share which conflicts with foo.  This needlessly
# loses.
#

# Substituted by pkgsrc at pre-configure time.

pkg_rolling-replace does 'make replace' on one package at a time,
tsorting the packages being replaced according to their
interdependencies, which avoids most duplicate rebuilds.

pkg_rolling-replace can be used in one of two ways:

    - 'make replace' is unsafe in that, if the replaced package's ABI
      changes, its dependent packages may break.  If this happens, run
      'pkg_rolling-replace' (no arguments) to rebuild them against the
      new version.

    - 'pkg_chk -u' will delete all your mismatched (outdated)
      packages, then reinstall them one at a time, leaving you without
      those packages in the meantime.  'pkg_rolling-replace -u' will
      instead upgrade them in place, allowing you to keep using your
      system in the meantime (maybe...if you're lucky...because
      pkg_rolling-replace replaces the \"deepest\" dependency first,
      things could still break if that happens to be a fundamental
      library whose ABI has changed).
