pkg_select will display a curses file browser for the pkg system. You can
browse pkgsrc and gather various informations about packages, like avail-
able version, installed version, comment and homepage. A simple paging
system lets you read information files.  You can browse both installed
and uninstalled packages, as well as dependencies list and perform vari-
ous administrative tasks to them. A package finder system helps you to
easily locate a package by its name.  pkg_select can handle either source
or binary installations when pkgsrc is installed on the local system, or
binary only when using the pkgsrc-over-ftp feature.

If no pkgsrc is installed, pkg_select offers ability fo fetch it, either
by FTP or CVS. It is also possible to update an existing pkgsrc via the
interface.

pkg_select user interface is quite self explainatory, every available
shortcut is shown and annotated.
