Xpkgwedge, not a "real" program in the traditional sense, is a hack that
allows users to compile X11 pkgs from pkgsrc and install them outside of
the X11 tree - even if they use imake - by using pkgxmkmf.

Pkgxmkmf is a slightly modified xmkmf from the X11R6.3 release and supports
finding config files in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/X11/config, if it exists, and in
${X11BASE}/lib/X11/config.  In all other respects, it is identical to xmkmf.
Please refer to xmkmf(1) for more information.
