pbulk is the modular bulk build framework for pkgsrc.

This package contains:

- pbulk-scan, a program to scan the entire pkgsrc tree
  or a list of directories therein for packages and
  dependencies. Distributed operation using a master/client
  mode is supported.

- pbulk-resolve, a program to resolve the dependencies
  from the output of pbulk-scan

- pbulk-build, the build scheduler. Distributed builds via TCP
  are supported.

- bulkbuild and related scripts to implement full and limited
  bulk builds on top of those programs.

The pbulk framework is considered experimental.
