.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds all packages specified in an input file.
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width 15n -offset indent
.It Fl b Ar build_script
Use
.Ar build_script
for building the packages.
See
.Sx BUILD SCRIPT FORMAT
for details.
.It Fl c Oo Ar ip: Oc Ns Ar port
Obtain jobs from master running on the given
.Ar port
(or
.Ar ip:port ) .
If used with
.Fl v ,
print the name of the package to build to stdout.
.It Fl I Ar start_script
Run
.Ar start_script
after opening the socket and wait for completion before entering build loop.
.It Fl m Oo Ar ip: Oc Ns Ar port
Enter master mode.
The master binds to
.Ar port
(or
.Ar ip:port )
and waits for clients to connect and build individual packages.
.It Fl s Oo Ar ip: Oc Ns Ar port
Query the master running on the given
.Ar port
(or
.Ar ip:port )
for the current number of successful, open, and failed builds.
.It Fl r Ar report_file
Write name of each package,
the result of its build,
whether the package belongs to the restricted subset
and the size of the subtree
to
.Ar report_file
at the end of the build.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
Details depend on the other flags used with it.
.El
In normal mode (neither
.Fl c ,
.Fl m ,
nor
.Fl s
specified) and master mode
.Pq Fl m ,
.Nm
reads the resolved tree scan from
.Ar input .
It then writes successful builds to
.Ar success
and failing builds to
.Ar error .
If either
.Ar success
or
.Ar error
exists at start-up, they are read and the build continues where
they left off.
If
.Fl v
is specified once,
.Nm
prints the start of each build and the result.
If
.Fl v
is specified twice, each begin and end message is prefixed with
the current time.
