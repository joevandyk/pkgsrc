 *
 * (jobs.c, init_jobs:) If scanning the package failed or the package is
 * not available for this configuration, its state is changed to
 * JOB_PREFAILED. Packages that are listed in the "error" log are marked
 * as JOB_FAILED, those in the the "success" log are marked as JOB_DONE.
 * The remaining jobs are marked as JOB_OPEN.
 *
 * The packages that are ready to be built are those that have the state
 * JOB_OPEN and no pending dependencies. At most one job can be in the
 * state JOB_IN_PROCESSING. After trying to build a job, its state is
 * set to either JOB_DONE or to JOB_FAILED. In the latter case, all the
 * jobs that depend on this one are marked as JOB_INDIRECT_FAILED.
