.Sh NAME
.Nm pbulk-resolve
.Nd resolves dependencies in
.Xr pbulk-scan 1
output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl i Ar missing
.Ar input Op ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
resolves dependencies based on the output of
.Xr pbulk-scan 1
saved in
.Ar input .
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Fl i Ar missing
Enter incremental mode.
For incremental mode, the package in
.Ar input
and the packages used to fulfill dependencies from the other input
files are written to standard output including the resolved
dependencies.
The location of each unresolved dependency is written to
.Ar missing .
In normal mode, unresolvable dependencies are printed and the
program exits with an error.
.It Fl v
If
.Fl v
is specified once and incremental mode is not active, a warning is
printed whenever the best matching package has a different location
than recorded in the dependency.
If
.Fl v
is specified twice, additionally a warning is printed whenever two
different packages can be used to fulfill a dependency.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with return value 1 if an error occurred, or 0 if all
dependencies have been resolved successfully.
In incremental mode,
.Ar missing
contains all correct, but unresolvable dependencies.
