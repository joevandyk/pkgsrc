A converter from a FreeBSD port to a NetBSD package.

port2pkg tries to convert FreeBSD ports to NetBSD packages.  port2pkg
copies files from portsdir to pkgsrcdir (if it does not exist, the
pkgsrcdir is created), and tries to adapt the Makefile, patches and
some files to NetBSD format in pkgsrcdir.

port2pkg /mnt/ports/<category>/foo /usr/pkgsrc/<category>/foo

Before committing a package which has been transformed using this
utility, please check the results manually.
