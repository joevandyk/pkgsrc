    The @MKCONF@ file seems to not include autoswc.mk.  This means that
    configure scripts will not find the generated cache file.  Add the
    following line to it:

    .sinclude "@PREFIX@/share/autoswc/autoswc.mk"

# name.

    cat <<EOF
    You have used a non-standard cache name.  To let configure scripts
    find it, you should add the following line somewhere in your
    @MKCONF@ file, in case it is not there yet:

    AUTOSWC_CACHE_NAME= ${cachename}

EOF
fi

# Warn the user about the dangers of using a system wide cache file.
cat <<EOF
    Please remember that by using a system wide cache file, you assume
    that the results stored in it may get outdated and cause strange build
    failures in third-party packages.  When reporting bugs, be absolutely
    sure it is not your fault.  Check the autoswc(8) manpage for more
    details.
