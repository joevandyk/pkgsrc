verifypc is a tool that sanity checks the dependencies of a package based on
the results of a successful build, assuming the package uses pkg-config to
detect dependencies.

verifypc will warn you if the configuration script requests an uninstalled
or unavailable package (not specified as a direct dependency) or if the
requested package does not match the version specification in the packages'
dependencies.
