.Dt URL2PKG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm url2pkg
.Nd Automatic pkgsrc package generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar URL
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes the
.Ar URL
to a package's distfile that should be
turned into a package. The
generated package includes a
.Pa Makefile
and a basic set of files to get the
package going. Any customisations to get the package going need to be
adjusted manually after
.Nm
has finished its job.
.Pp
.Nm
is intended to help starting to created a package, it is not
intended to fly on autopilot, though.
.Pp
The
.Pa Makefile
contains all the required variables, such as DISTNAME or MASTER_SITES, but some of them cannot be automatically set. Hence, the user's usual editor is invoked to edit the
.Pa Makefile .
.Pp
After the
.Pa Makefile
is completed,
.Nm
fetches the archive, and computes its checksum via the
.Ic make makesum
target. Then archive extraction is done, via the
.Ic make extract
target, and finally,
.Nm
attempts to detect if
the software uses a
.Ic configure
script, and if it's from GNU
.Ic autoconf .
.Pp
If the user does not supply the
.Ar URL
on the command line, then
.Nm
will prompt for it.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It PKGEDITOR, EDITOR
Editor used for
.Pa Makefile
edition.
.It PKGMAINTAINER, REPLYTO
Name used for the MAINTAINER field in the package
.Pa Makefile .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
.Ar http://www.foo.com/bar/buz.tgz
.Pp
Will generate a template
.Nx
package for the software that can be found at
.Ar http://www.foo.com/bar/buz.tgz .
