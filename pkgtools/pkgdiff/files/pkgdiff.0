     The ppkkggddiiffff utility runs diff(1) on the named files, and generates output
     on stdout that is appropriate to be put as patch file into pkgsrc.  An
     empty NetBSD RCS ID is output first, and some effort is made to ensure
     that the generated patch does not include any RCS IDs.

     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s can be any options that are allowed for diff(1).

     The flags passed to diff(1) when generating patches.  If not set, the
     flags --uu and --pp are used.  Though only unified format patches are used in
     pkgsrc as proper patches, sometimes it can be useful to have context or
     plain diffs available.
