     mmkkppaattcchheess is a perl script that simplifies creating patches from a
     changed work tree if for each changed file the original was kept with an
     added extension ``.orig''.

     mmkkppaattcchheess must be called from the package's main directory, that is
     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_}_/_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_/_p_r_o_g_r_a_m.  It then proceeds to find all files that
     match the pattern ``*.orig''.  Each of these is then compared to the
     changed file of the same name (with no ``.orig'' extension) using
     pkgdiff(1).

     The resulting patches are saved in the directory _$_{_W_R_K_D_I_R_}_/_._n_e_w_p_a_t_c_h_e_s or
     the directory specified after --dd, and can be easily compared to the cur-
     rently existing set using patchdiff(1).
