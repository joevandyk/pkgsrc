     ppaattcchhddiiffff is a perl script that simplifies comparing a set of previously
     existing patches with a new one created with mkpatches(1).

     ppaattcchhddiiffff must be called from the package's main directory, that is
     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_}_/_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_/_p_r_o_g_r_a_m.  For each patch existing in either the
     patches or the _$_{_W_R_K_D_I_R_}_/_._n_e_w_p_a_t_c_h_e_s directory (the second of which can
     be overridden by the argument of the --dd option), a matching patch is
     looked for in the other directory, and, if one is found, the two are com-
     pared with diff(1).
