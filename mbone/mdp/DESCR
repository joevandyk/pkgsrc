The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol framework and
software toolkit for reliable multicasting data objects.  A primary
design goal of MDP is to provide a reliable multicast protocol approach
which is suitable for reliable dissemination of data over both wireless
and wired networks.

MDP software has been demonstrated across a range of network architecture
and heterogeneous conditions including; the worldwide Internet MBone,
bandwidth and routing asymmetric network connections, high delay satellite
networks, and mobile, radio networks.  MDP version 2, the latest software
release and ongoing work, integrates numerous multicast protocol advances
including highly robust, packet-based erasure correction techniques and
adaptive group timing mechanisms.

The present MDPv2 software release has a defined API library and several
example working applications including a multicast file transfer applications
and a very basic multicast chat application. To learn more and/or download
the software see the following sections.
