mdd stands for multicast data dump. It was designed for distributing
a file using multicast. The primary goal was to replicate a hard disk
image on all the workstations of a computer room at the same time.

The protocol used is rather simple and will not make any effort to avoid
flooding your network. IGMP-snooping enabled switches are advised.

WARNING: this tool is designed to operate on a private LAN where no
congestion occurs. It has no rate limiting feature, which makes it
unsuitable for use on the Internet. Do not try to use it outside of
a private LAN, it will attempt to eat all your bandwidth to flood the
multicast group you send data to.
