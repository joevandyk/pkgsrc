The rtptools distribution consists of a number of small applications that
can be used for processing RTP data:

rtpdump: parse and print RTP packets, generating output files suitable
         for rtpplay and rtpsend.

rtpplay:  play back RTP sessions recorded by rtpdump.

rtpsend:  generate RTP packets from textual description, generated by
          hand or rtpdump.

rtptrans: RTP translator between unicast and multicast networks.
