The UCB/LBNL video tool, vic, is a real-time, multimedia application
for video conferencing over the Internet.

Vic was designed with a flexible and extensible architecture to support
heterogeneous environments and configurations.  For example, in high
bandwidth settings, multi-megabit full-motion JPEG streams can be
sourced using hardware assisted compression, while in low bandwidth
environments like the Internet, aggressive low bit-rate coding can
be carried out in software.
