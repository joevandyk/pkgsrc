IMM has been designed to efficiently replicate files/file directories
using a reliable dissemination protocol framework and provide archiving
and post processing features.  The default mode of operation is for imm
to receive and display compressed imagery files (e.g., jpg,gif) using
xv or xloadimage as a post processor.

The sdr plugin file from the earlier imm release has been integrated into
the NetBSD sdr package.
