NTE is a shared text editor designed for use on the Mbone.   It is
not a word processor  and it is not a whiteboard - if you want  a
whiteboard, wb from LBL is a much better whiteboard.

Using NTE can be very interactive - unless you lock a block of
text, anyone else in your session can edit that text or delete it.
This is intentional. Many people can (if they wish) edit the same
document simultaneously. Many people can even edit the same block
of text simultaneously, but if  more than one person tries to edit
the same line at one time, a conflict will occur, which results in
only one of the changes being preserved.

In general, it is up to you how you use NTE.  You must develop
human protocols to be able to collaborate, even in face-to-face
meetings, and NTE is no exception.  It will work well if you
cooperate, and not if you don't.
