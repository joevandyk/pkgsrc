PilotManager is a tool that allows you to synchronize databases on any
3Com Palm device (PalmPilot, PalmIII, PalmIIIx, PalmV, more?) with
applications on your Unix platform. It is a full Hotsync daemon that is user
extensible. Developers can write their own conduits to synchronize Pilot
databases with the desktop application of their choice!
