NB: The console command from versions of conserver prior to 8 does not
interoperate with conserver version 8.

The config file formats have changed from version 7.x.x of
conserver.

For instruction on how to convert your configurtion files from conserver
version 7.x.x see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/conserver/INSTALL.
The "convert" program was installed as ${PREFIX}/lib/conserver/convert.

Briefly:
mv ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.cf ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.cf-7
mv ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.passwd ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.passwd-7
${PREFIX}/lib/conserver/convert ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.cf-7 >\
		 ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.cf
awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $2}' < ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.passwd-7 > \
		 ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/conserver.passwd
