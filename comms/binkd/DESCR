Binkd is a Fidonet mailer designed to operate via TCP/IP networks.  As a
FTN-compatible internet daemon, it makes possible efficient utilization of
TCP/IP protocol suite as a transport layer in FTN-based (Fido Technology
Network) networks.

Binkd expects your spool for Fido-like networks to be in BSO ("Bink style
outbound") format. BSO is also used by ifmail and BinkleyTerm mailers.
