This program is a Gtk+/Gtk-- front end for the efax program for
receiving and sending faxes with a fax modem.  To use it you must have
efax and ghostscript installed, and the executables (efax, efix and
gs) must be situated in the default system path.

Any files to be faxed must be in postscript format, which is the
generic printer format for Unix/Linux systems.  The program will use
ghostscript to convert these into the Group 3 fax format which the fax
modem will understand.
