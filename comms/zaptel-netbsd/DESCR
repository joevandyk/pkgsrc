This package provides the "zaptel" drivers, which support the Asterisk
software PBX, ported to NetBSD.

These are some drivers and auxiliary tools for NetBSD in support of
the Asterisk PBX.  The wcfxo driver supports the Wildcard X100P/X101P and
clones, the wcfxs driver supports the Wildcard TDM400p, and the ztdummy
driver provides a software-only timer device which makes conferencing
work much better. (That is, if you run Asterisk, you may want these
drivers even if you don't have any of the hardware)

The T1 board driver has not yet been ported.
