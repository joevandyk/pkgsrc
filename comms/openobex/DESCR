The overall goal of the OpenOBEX project is to make an open source
implementation of the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol.  OBEX is a session
protocol and can best be described as a binary HTTP protocol.  OBEX is
optimised for ad-hoc wireless links and can be used to exchange all kind
of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vCal) and business
cards (vCard).
