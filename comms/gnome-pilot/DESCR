Gnome-Pilot is a package with a daemon (gpilotd) that monitor for
pilot connects on one or more devices (cradles/XCopilots/xxx). It has
a conduit system, and is accompanied by a few conduits, basically for
installing files and backing up db's from the pilot.

A few more interesting conduits exist, eg. the email conduit.
