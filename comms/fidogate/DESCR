FIDOGATE is a Fido-Internet gateway and a Fido tosser.  It is placed under
the GNU General Public License, see COPYING for details.

The gateway converts between the worlds of Fido NetMail/EchoMail (or FTNs,
Fido Technology Networks in general) and the UNIX mail/news system.
FIDOGATE will convert Fido mail packets to RFC822/1036-style messages and
vice versa.

FIDOGATE also includes a complete FIDO mail processor (NetMail/EchoMail
scanner and tosser), an FTN-FTN gateway (NetMail only), a file processor
(TIC file areas) and an Areafix/Filefix.
