This is a POSIX-based version of the Win32::Serialport module ported by
Joe Doss for the MisterHouse Home Automation Package from Version 0.08
of the Win32 module. He replaced calls to the Win32 API with similar
functions implemented using POSIX calls. While most of the testing has
occurred on linux, the package should work on other POSIX-compliant
Operating Systems.
