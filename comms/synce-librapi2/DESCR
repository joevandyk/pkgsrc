Librapi is part of the SynCE project.

The RAPI library is an open source implementation that works like
RAPI.DLL, available on Microsoft operating systems. The library
makes it possible to make remote calls to a computer running Pocket
PC.

In order to use librapi, a daemon that the Pocket PC client connects
to must be running on the computer using librapi.
