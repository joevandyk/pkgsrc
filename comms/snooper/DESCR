Snooper is a tool for snooping communication between two devices
that communicate with an RS232C serial line.

For example, say you would like to snoop the following configuration
		partyA ---cableAB--- partyB
where partyA is a computer and partyB is a computer/modem/digi-cam/whatever.

A third machine called "console" running snooper can be used to snoop
the connection between partyA and cableAB, as follows:
	partyA ---cableX--- <dev0>console<dev1>---cableAB--- party B

cableX must be cross-cable (a cable to connect two computers).

Command-line options:
	% snooper [-options] dev0 dev1
		-bBAUD	specifies baud rate.
		-u	don't use uucp locking (questionable option)
