 This package is heavily based on two other packages:

   - p3nfsd-5.4 by Rudolf Koenig (rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de)
     an nfs daemon for Psion series 3 and 5
   - plp_1_7 by Philip Proudman
	(former email, current address unknown proudman@btinternet.com)

 The programs:

 ncpd is the daemon which handles the serial link to your Psion.
 It listens at port 7501 for local connections and provides
 basic PLP/NCP services for the other two programs. It auto-
 connects to the psion, even after unplugging/switching off
 therefore it can run always in background (if you have a
 spare serial-device)

 plpftp is a FTP-like program for manipulating files on the Psion.

 plpnfsd is a daemon, which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.
 It automatically makes the psion's filesystems available below
 an NFS-mounted directory (default /mnt/psion).
