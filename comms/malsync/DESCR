  MalSync is a bare bones utility to enable people who have Palm OS
devices to sync to Mobile Application Link (MAL) compliant servers.
AvantGo (www.avantgo.com) and Puma Technologies (www.pumatech.com)
are the first two companies committing to producing servers which
speak this protocol.  This utility will allow a user to sync with
multiple servers, simultaneously or separately.  The AvantGo.com
service (www.avantgo.com) is the first such server.
