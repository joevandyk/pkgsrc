Newspipe is an RSS/Atom aggregator with a difference: it allows
you to keep track of your feeds through email. You create an OPML
file listing your feeds and Newspipe will collect them, convert
them to e-mail messages and send them to your mailbox.

This means you can read, organize and archive news feeds using your
current mail client (or even webmail), without needing to use a
separate program. Newspipe can send you news items as plaintext or
HTML mail, both as single items or grouped in a digest.
