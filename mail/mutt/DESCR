``All mail clients suck.  This one just sucks less.'' -me, circa 1995

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.
Mutt is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power
user with advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros,
mail threading, color, PGP, POP3, IMAP, various mailbox formats,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.
