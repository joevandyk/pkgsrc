J-chkmail is a mail filtering software using the API milter of sendmail
(versions 8.12.0 and later). Yet another filter...

j-chkmail intends to be a scalable integrated solution to fight against
virus and spam.

In both cases, the main idea of j-chkmail is to avoid content filtering,
but to do behavior filtering.
