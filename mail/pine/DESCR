Pine is a tool for reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.
It was designed specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can
be tailored to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
Internet message protocols (e.g.  RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and
runs on Unix and PCs.
