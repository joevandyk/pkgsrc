libESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) electronic
mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA).

It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA) or another program that
needs to post electronic mail but where mail functionality is not
the program's primary purpose.
