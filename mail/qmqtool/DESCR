qmqtool is a qmail queue manipulation program geared towards the
viewing and safe modification of the contents in a qmail queue.

qmqtool was designed with Michele Beltrame's "qmHandle" in mind,
however no source code from qmHandle was used within qmqtool.

qmqtool is significantly faster than qmHandle 1.2.0 on the author's
system, even though it has more work to do (such as examining the
todo queue).
