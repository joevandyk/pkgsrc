       Elm is an interactive screen-oriented mailer program  that
       supersedes mail and mailx.

       It is itself superseeded by mutt, in the view of many people.

       This is the ME extended version which deals with MIME messages
       a lot better than the regular elm. The regular elm can be found
       in the mail/elm package.
