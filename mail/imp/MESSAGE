Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/imp/INSTALL

on how to setup your IMP installation. You need to at least edit

	${PREFIX}/share/horde/config/registry.php

to enable IMP in the horde framework.  You will also need to configure IMP
by using the Horde administrative interface.

Finally you will also need to make IMP accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/imp.conf
