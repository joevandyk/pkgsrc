Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the Mozilla mail component. The
goal is to produce a cross platform stand alone mail application using
the XUL user interface language. This version uses the gtk2 toolkit.

Note: Thunderbird 1.5.0.x will be maintained with security and stability
updates until October 18, 2007. All users are strongly encouraged to
upgrade to Thunderbird 2.
