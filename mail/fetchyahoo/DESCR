FetchYahoo is a Perl script that downloads mail from a Yahoo! account
to a local mail spool. It is meant to replace fetchmail for people
using Yahoo! mail since Yahoo!'s POP service no longer free. It
downloads messages to a local mail spool, including all parts and
attachments. It then deletes messages unless requested not to. It can
also optionally forward messages to a specified e-mail address and
repeat with a given interval.
