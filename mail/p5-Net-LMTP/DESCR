This module implements a client interface to the LMTP protocol, enabling a
perl5 application to talk to LMTP servers. This documentation assumes that
you are familiar with the concepts of the LMTP protocol described in RFC2033.
This module is based on Net::SMTP and shares more than %95 of its code with
Net::SMTP.
