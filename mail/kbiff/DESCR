KBiff is a "biff" or new mail notification utility. It is highly configurable
but very easy to use and setup. It tries to combine the best of the features
of most of the "other" biff programs out there.

KBiff supports all major mailbox formats: mbox (Berkely style), maildir, mh,
POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP.
