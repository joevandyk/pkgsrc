Turba is a set of PHP scripts that implement a contacts directory and
management interface. Turba also provides an API for external applications
to interface with address books, providing adding and searching features that
can be hooked right into other applications.

Turba is a complete basic contact management application. SQL, LDAP, and Horde
Preferences backends are available and are well tested. The fields in the
address books can be defined in a very flexible way, just by changing the
config files. Import/export from/to Pine, Mulberry, CSV, TSV, and vCard
contacts. You can create distribution lists from your addressbooks, which are
handled transparently by IMP and other Horde applications. And there are Horde
API functions to add and search for contacts.
