Mailman is software to help manage electronic mail discussion lists,
much like Majordomo or Smartmail.  Mailman gives each mailing list a unique
web page and allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their
account options over the web.  Even the list manager can administer his or
her list entirely via the web.  Mailman has most of the features that
people want in a mailing list management system, including built-in
archiving, mail-to-news gateways, spam filters, bounce detection, digest
delivery, and so on.  See the features page (http://www.list.org/features.html)
for more detail.
