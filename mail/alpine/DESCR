Alpine is the replacement for the Pine email and news client.

Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool. In its default
configuration, Alpine offers an intentionally limited set of
functions geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large
list of optional "power-user" and personal-preference features.

This package currently only installs the alpine binary, excluding
the pilot and pico binaries which would cause it to conflict with
the pine package.
