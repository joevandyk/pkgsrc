Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps
manually:

	- install majordomo.cf in ${HOME}/${MAJORDOMO_USER}.
	  Look in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/majordomo for an example and
	  be sure to change instances of ${HOSTNAME} as appropriate.

	- create lists in ${HOME}/${MAJORDOMO_USER}.
	  Look in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/majordomo for information and see
	  the files and directories for an example list (example-l) in
	  ${PREFIX}/share/examples/majordomo.  Pay attention to the
	  permissions on the files and directories.

	- add a .forward file in ${HOME}/${MAJORDOMO_USER} (or an
	  appropriate alias) so administrative mail to
	  ${MAJORDOMO_USER} gets redirected properly.

	- install majordomo aliases for sendmail.
	  For example, create /etc/aliases.majordomo following the
	  example in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/majordomo and add it to
	  your sendmail configuration.  This can be done by adding a
	  line similar to the following to /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  OA/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.6.x Sendmail),

	  O AliasFile=/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.7.x and up),

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`ALIAS_FILE',`/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo')

	- if the group for ${MAJORDOMO_USER} (${MAJORDOMO_GROUP}) is not
	  daemon, add ${MAJORDOMO_USER} as a trusted user for sendmail.
	  This can be done by adding a line similar to the following
	  in /etc/sendmail.cf:

	  T${MAJORDOMO_USER}

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`confTRUSTED_USERS', ${MAJORDOMO_USER})dnl

	- be sure to run `newaliases' to create the sendmail database,
	  and be sure that sendmail knows about any changes to
	  /etc/sendmail.cf (e.g., reboot or restart sendmail)

	- add entries in /etc/newsyslog.conf to rotate the log in
	  ${HOME}/${MAJORDOMO_USER}/Log if necessary.

Enjoy Majordomo!
