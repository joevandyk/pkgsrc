Hypermail is a program that takes a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox
format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents.

This version of hypermail has substantial support for attachments and for
splitting archives into subdirectories. It also allows an administrator to
customize the header and footers to match their local needs.  This allows
you to have hypermail facilities better integrated into your web site.
