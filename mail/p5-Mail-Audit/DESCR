`Mail::Audit' was inspired by Tom Christiansen's audit_mail and
deliverlib programs. It allows a piece of email to be logged, examined,
accepted into a mailbox, filtered, resent elsewhere, rejected, and so
on. It's designed to allow you to easily create filter programs to stick
in a .forward file or similar.
