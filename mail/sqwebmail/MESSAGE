You must create a cron job that runs at regular intervals (one hour is
fine) that executes the following Perl script to clean the SqWebMail
user cache:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/cleancache.pl

There are two things which must be done to make SqWebMail accessible
through your HTTP server:

  (1) Copy the ``webmail'' CGI binary to the appropriate place in your
      HTTP document root, e.g. ${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin.  Maildir
      accounts would be accessible through, e.g.:

        http://your.domain.com/cgi-bin/webmail

  (2) Make URLs with path ``${IMAGEURL}/'' resolve to the images located
      in the ${IMAGEDIR} directory.
      For Apache, you can add the following to httpd.conf:

        <IfModule mod_alias.c>
	    Alias ${IMAGEURL}/ "${IMAGEDIR}/"
        </IfModule>

If you're using a non-default sendmail program, you will need to edit:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sendit.sh

To use GPG with SqWebMail, you will need to install the security/gnupg
package and you should read the documentation at:

    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/courier/sqwebmail/README.gpg.html
