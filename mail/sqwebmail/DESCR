SqWebMail is a web CGI client for sending and receiving E-mail using
maildir mailboxes.  It is very lightweight -- it reads mail directly
from maildirs.  It also contains a web-based calendar application.

This package differs from a vanilla SqWebMail installation in that
the files are installed at locations that more closely correspond to
a Courier installation.
