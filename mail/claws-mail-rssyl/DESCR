The RSSyl plugin is an RSS feed aggregator for Claws Mail. It has the
following features:

    * Handling of RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and Atom feeds
    * Fetching and threaded display of comment feeds
    * Customisable refresh interval for each feed
    * Customisable number of feed items to keep for each feed

Navigating in your feeds and posts is done in the same way as you would
for emails, which makes feed-reading really fast and enjoyable if Claws
Mail's shortcuts are hardwired into your fingers.
Also, the RSSyl plugin unleashes its full potential when used with an HTML
viewer plugin like Dillo or Gtkhtml2Viewer, as this allows fetching a
post's images and font styles.
