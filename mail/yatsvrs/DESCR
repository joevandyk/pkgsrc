YAT is an extended POP3 server and supporting servers.
It contains the following programs.

	yatd		YAT server; extended POP3 server
	ascyd		Apop shared Secret changer for Yatsvr
	yatconfd	YAT configuration daemon

Yatd was based on Berkeley's popper program and previously known as
yatsvr.  Yatd has its own extension to the POP3 protocol for
WinYAT, a commercial product from JEPRO Co., Ltd, but it still
works as standard POP3 server.  The extension to POP3 is documented
in an attached Japanese document.
