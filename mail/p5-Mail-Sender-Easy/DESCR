Mail::Sender's one problem is its a bit cumbersome to use, with so
many options and things to open, close, the whole thing, parts,
multiparts etc etc., and several ways to check for successs. Its
hard to remember what needs done at what point with what data to
do what you want and then which way you check what data based on
what was done to see if it worked or not.

This module's aim is to make all of that ``Easy''

It does so by providing a single function (and method) to send mail
based on an (IMHO) easier to work with hashref and returns true or
false on success or failer and sets $@ to any errors.

The EXAMPLE section shows an ``email or die'' that will send an
email using SMTP Auth on port 26 with text and html parts, the html
part has a smiley gif embedded inline and a PDF attached and a high
priority flag and read and delivery receipt requests. It will take
you seconds to customize it to send that to yourself (and its
``Easy'' to understand what its going on without having to understand
the intracacies of SMTP and MIME messages.
