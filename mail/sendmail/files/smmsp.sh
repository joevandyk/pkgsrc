# REQUIRE: mail

#	The only function of the smmsp process is to push locally
#	collected mail (which got stuck in the local client queue)
#	to a more fully functional smtp relay.  It is not a fully
#	functional smtp daemon.
#
#	It can, however, be used as a completely unprivileged
#	replacement for hosts that were previously using a "null
#	client" configuration and a smart relay.
