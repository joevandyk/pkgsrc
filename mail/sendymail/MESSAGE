	To use sendymail,

        1) Create a ~/.sendymailrc file by copying
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/sendymail/sendymailrc.sample
        to ~/.sendymailrc and edit the file.

	2) Give the proper permissions to the configuration file:

		$ chmod 600 ~/.sendymailrc

	3) Configure your MUA (mail client). sendymail has a
	Sendmail-like interface, so you have to create a "sendmail"
	account to outgoing messages and set the path of the sendmail
	command to the sendymail script location. Eg: For Mutt,
	edit ~/.muttrc and change "sendmail" variable:

	set sendmail="${PREFIX}/bin/sendymail"
