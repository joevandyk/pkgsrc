Postfix aims to be an alternative to the widely-used sendmail
program.  Sendmail is responsible for 70% of all e-mail delivered
on the Internet.  With an estimated 100 million users, that's an
estimated 10 billion (10^10) messages daily. A stunning number.

Although IBM supported the Postfix development, it abstains from
control over its evolution. The goal is to have Postfix installed
on as many systems as possible. To this end, the software is given
away with no strings attached to it, so that it can evolve with
input from and under control by its users.

In other words, IBM releases Postfix only once. I will be around
to guide its development for a limited time.
