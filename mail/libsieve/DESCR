This code is a standalone library providing an interpreter for RFC 3028 Sieve
and various extensions. It is based upon code distributed with the Cyrus Mail
Server prior to CMU's switch to a more restrictive license. The libSieve API
attempts to be easy to use and extensible, and replaces the more rigid API in
the Cyrus Sieve implementation.
