In order to enable APOP, you have to create the authentication database.
It is no longer created as part of the installation, you should run
the following command to create it:
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/qpopauth -init -safe

In order to enable POP service, you should add the following lines
to your /etc/inetd.conf:

    pop3 stream tcp  nowait root ${PREFIX}/libexec/qpopper qpopper -s
    pop3 stream tcp6 nowait root ${PREFIX}/libexec/qpopper qpopper -s

Or, you can start stand alone qpopper using ${RCD_SCRIPTS_DIR}/${RCD_SCRIPTS}.
