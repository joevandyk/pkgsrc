t-prot is a TOFU enhancement for the mutt MUA.  It condenses quoted
text into a single line, hides overlong signatures, and other email
sins.

TOFU is an abbreviation which mixes German and English words; it
expands to "text oben, full-quote unten" which means "text above -
full quote below" and describes the style of so many users who let
their mailer or newsreader quote everything of the previous message
and just add some text at the top; obviously they think that quoted
text must not be changed at all.  This is quite annoying as it
needlessly sends a lot of data even when it is not required.  Some
editing of messages is desired.  Please point these people to the page

t-prot detects, and when demanded hides annoying parts in rfc2822
messages:  TOFU, huge quoted blocks, signatures (especially when they
are too long), excessive punktuation, blocks of empty lines, trailing
spaces and tabs.  For use inside of MTAs or MDAs it exits with
appropriate libc exit codes, so annoying messages may be bounced
easily.
