  Pantomime provides a set of Objective-C classes that model a mail system.
Pantomime can be seen as a JavaMail 1.2 clone written in Objective-C.
Pantomime is almost entirely written in Objective-C.  The C language is
only used where performance is critical.  Pantomime uses a little bit of
ELM code.

  Pantomime provides the following features:

    * A full MIME encoder and decoder
    * A 'folder view' to local mailboxes (Berkeley Format), POP3 accounts
      or IMAP mailboxes
    * A powerful API to work on all aspects of Message objects
    * A local mailer and a SMTP conduit for sending messages
    * APOP and SMTP AUTH support
    * IMAP and POP3 URL Scheme support
    * iconv and Core Foundation support
    * SSL support for IMAP and POP3
    * and more!
