ifile is a general mail filtering system which uses a modern-day text learning
algorithm to intelligently filter mail according to the way the user tends to
organize mail.

ifile is different from other mail filtering programs in three major ways:

 1. ifile does not require the user to generate a set of rules in order to
    successfully filter mail
 2. ifile uses the entire content of messages for filtering purposes
 3. ifile learns as the user moves incorrectly filtered messages to new
    mailboxes

ifile is not dependent upon any specific mail system and should be adaptable
to any system which allows an outside program to perform mail filtering.
