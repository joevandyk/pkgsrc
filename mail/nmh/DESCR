nmh (new MH) is an electronic mail handling system.  It was originally
based on the package MH-6.8.3, and is intended to be a (mostly)
compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

Although development of nmh is ongoing, it appears to be generally
stable and is in current use.  But it is possible that I may break
things as changes are made.

nmh is currently being developed and maintained by Richard Coleman
<coleman@math.gatech.edu>.  Please send bug reports and suggestions to
the nmh development mailing list at nmh-workers@math.gatech.edu.
