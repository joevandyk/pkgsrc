The libgmail project is a pure Python binding to provide access to
Google's Gmail web-mail service.

The library allows the user to log into an account, retrieve a list of
threads, display information about them and display the source of the
individual messages.

In addition, the library allows the user to:
	Archive Gmail messages to mbox format

	Use your Gmail account as a SMTP server

	Use your Gmail account as a POP server

	Use your Gmail account as a FTP server!
