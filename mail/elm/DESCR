Elm is an interactive screen-oriented mailer program that
needed no documentation for the casual user, but was still
powerful enough and sophisticated enough for a mail expert.

It is superseeded by mutt, in the view of many people.

This package is the standard version of elm. Older versions
of this package installed the ME extended version of elm, but
this extensions are not available for the latest elm versions.
There is another package now providing this extended, but older
version in mail/elm-me.
