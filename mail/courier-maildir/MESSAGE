If you are planning on using Courier-IMAP or SqWebMail to serve mail
on the system and you will be using shared maildirs, then you should
create a cron job that runs at regular intervals (once every few hours
is fine) that executes the following script to update the shared folder
index:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sharedindexupdate
