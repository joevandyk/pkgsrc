Claws-mail is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on
X Window System, and aiming for

 * Quick response
 * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
 * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
 * Abundant features

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail
clients for Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula.
The interface is also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen,
and almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.

The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use
it together with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You
can also utilize fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs
on receiving (like inc or imget).

Claws-mail was based on Sylpheed (and was once known as sylpheed-claws),
but now this extended version adds many useful and powerful features,
such as a plugin mechanism, built-in image viewer, drag-n-drop
support, and a lot more.
