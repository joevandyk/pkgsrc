Cone is a text-based mail client.  Cone seamlessly handles multiple
POP3, IMAP accounts, and local mail folders.  Cone is also a simple
newsreader.  Cone's interface is foolproof enough to be used by
inexperienced users, but it also offers advanced features for power
users.  Cone also serves as a platform for development of a new
experimental network mail access protocol, SMAP, that offers additional
functionality not available with IMAP or POP3.
