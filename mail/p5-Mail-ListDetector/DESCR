This module analyzses Mail::Internet objects. It returns a
Mail::ListDetector::List object representing the mailing list.

The RFC2369 mailing list detector is also capable of matching some
Mailman and Ezmlm messages. It is deliberately checked last to allow
the more specific Mailman and Ezmlm parsing to happen first, and more
accurately identify the type of mailing list involved.
