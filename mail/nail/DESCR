Nail is a mail user agent derived from Berkeley Mail 8.1. It is
intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX.2 mailx command
with built-in support for MIME messages. This means it can handle
international character sets as well as attachments. In recent
system environments, nail is Unicode/UTF-8 capable. It further
contains some minor enhancements like the ability to set a "From:"
Address.
