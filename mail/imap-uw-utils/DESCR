This distribution contains two unsupported programs, icat and ifrom,
which may be of use to some sites.

	icat		"cat" a mailbox from an IMAP source
	ifrom		one line per message summary of IMAP mailbox

There were once other programs in this distribution as well:

The old chkmail, imapcopy, imapxfer, mbxcopy, mbxcreat, and mbxcvt
programs have been replaced with the mailutil program, which is
included in the mail/imap-uw package.

The dmail, mlock, and tmail programs are also bundled in the mail/imap-uw
package.
