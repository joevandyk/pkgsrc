Sympa is a mailing-list manager. As such, its goal is to automate all
mailing-list operation such as subscription with automatic authentication,
unsubscription, but also archiving message, sending digests on a regular
basis, expiration of addresses, and so on.

Sympa is developped by the CRU (French Universities Network Committee) ;
it is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
Version 2.

Sympa is designed to be highly customizable, easy to manage and efficient.
Sympa is therefore a nice solution for managing small intranet mailing
lists as well as very large ISP mailing list services.
