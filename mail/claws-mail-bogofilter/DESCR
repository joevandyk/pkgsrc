The Bogofilter plugin provides anti-spam capabilities for Claws
Mail. Bogofilter is a pure Bayesian filter, written in C, which
makes it very fast. Claws Mail also provides a SpamAssassin anti-spam
plugin, with the same feature set, but more extensive 'spaminess'
checks. The Bogofilter plugin features are:

	* Filtering spam when mail is received, moving it to a specific
	  folder, or destroying it completely,
	* Learning what is spam and what is ham, in order to better
	  filter your mailbox.

Before Bogofilter is able to function effectively, you have to show
it a few of your spam emails and a few real emails. You can do that
by selecting some messages, right-clicking on them and choosing
'Mark/Mark as spam' or 'Mark/Mark as ham'.
