This is an addition and patch to ezmlm-0.53 [(c) Dan J. Bernstein].
Ezmlm-idx uses Dan's libraries and heavily relies on ezmlm-0.53
code.  ezmlm-idx does not function without ezmlm-0.53.

ezmlm-0.53 provides basic message distribution, subscriber address
handling, message archiving (single quoted message retrieval only),
and bounce handling. ezmlm-idx adds multi-message threaded archive
retrieval, digests, remote administration, message and subscription
moderation, subscriber-only restrictions, message trailer, subject
prefix, subscriber name storage, customizable setup, multi-language
and MIME support and more. In addition, improved bounce handling,
case-insensitive subscriber address storage, and support for
distributed lists (main + sublist transparent to the subscriber).
Ezmlm-idx can now be compiled with MySQL or Postgres support.
