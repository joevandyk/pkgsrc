  MailServ provides a World Wide Web interface to several types of mailing
list servers.  Users can select commands, enter information, and press
buttons to send email commands to the mail server.

  MailServ does not provide the actual mailing list services (you'll need
to have an existing mailing list management program to do that), but what
do you expect -- MailServ is free!
