The xmailbox program started out as an enhanced xbiff. However, the latest
version includes support for sound effects and animation. The default
functionality employs two images for the "mail in mailbox" and "no mail"
states, in the form of XPM type 3 files. The default images are, respectively,
that of an empty mailbox with its flag down, and that of an open mailbox,
with its flag up and a letter visible inside. Animation can be enabled for
playing up to 8 XPM files in repeated sequence.

The application can also, optionally, play a sound through a workstation's
audio device, instead of generating the default beep sound, whenever new
mail arrives.

By default, pressing any mouse button in the image forces xmailbox to
remember the current size of the mail file as being the "empty" size and
to change its image accordingly. In addition to this, the user can
optionally have xmailbox invoke his/her favourite mail retrieving program.
