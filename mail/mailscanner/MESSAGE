See ${PREFIX}/share/doc/MailScanner/README and the MailScanner(8) and
MailScanner.conf(5) man pages for further instructions.

As MailScanner supports a wide variety of external 3rd party software,
you must install other packages separately to achieve your desired
MailScanner functionality.

You need at the very least an MTA. You will probably also want SpamAssassin
and/or a virus scanner. Some suggested packages are:

	mail/spamassassin
	mail/clamav
	mail/p5-Mail-ClamAV

You will need to edit at least the following config file before MailScanner
will work correctly:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/MailScanner.conf
