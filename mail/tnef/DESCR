TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type
"application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment.  Due to the
proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers, more and
more mail is encapsulated into this format.  The TNEF program allows
one to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated into the TNEF
attachment, thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook to view
the attachment.
