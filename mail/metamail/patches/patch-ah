 2.  Non-text data.  Metamail can include pictures, sounds, and other non-textual data in the middle of any mail message.  The mailcap configuration mechanism can even make this process reasonably user-friendly, but a knowledgable user can include non-textual data even in the absence of a proper mailcap entry.

 Altered editing behavior:
-The ~e and ~v commands, which are used to edit the message being composed, will behave differently in mailto if the mail includes non-text portions.  In such cases, each part will be edited separately, in sequence, which makes it impossble for the user to accidentally mess up the inter-part boundaries.  Moreover, if the mailcap entry for a given data type includes an "edit" field, the user will be given the choice of editing with the program named there or editing with his usual (text) editor.  In most cases, this will be a choice between using a structured editor or editing the raw data stream.
