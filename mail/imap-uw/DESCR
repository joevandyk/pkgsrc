The UW imapd is the reference implementation of the IMAP4 protocol for
interactive remote retrieval of mail and storage of mail folders.  Also
included are POP2 and POP3 servers and an IMAP protocol tester (mtest).

The Pine mail program includes an IMAP4 client driver, as does Netscape
version 4 and above.
