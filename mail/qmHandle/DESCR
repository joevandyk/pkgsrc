qmHandle is a simple perl script which allows you to view and manage the qmail
message queue.

The key features of qmHandle are:

* Freeware and open source, under the GNU General Public License
* You can read the qmail queue, like you do with the qmail-qread program.
  However, the output of this program is improved over qmail-qread,
  with the output of the message subjects and color capabilities
* You can print queue statistics, like qmail-qstat with color capabilities
* You can view a message in the queue
* You can remove a message from the queue
