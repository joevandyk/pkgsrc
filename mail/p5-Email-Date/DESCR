RFC 2822 defines the "Date:" header. It declares the header a required
part of an email message. The syntax for date headers is clearly laid out.
Stil, even a perfectly planned world has storms. The truth is, many programs
get it wrong. Very wrong. Or, they don't include a "Date:" header at all.
This often forces you to look elsewhere for the date, and hoping to find
something.

For this reason, the tedious process of looking for a valid date has been
encapsulated in this software. Further, the process of creating RFC compliant
date strings is also found in this software.
