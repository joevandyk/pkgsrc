  IMAP::Admin provides basic IMAP server adminstration.  It
provides functions for creating and deleting mailboxes and
setting various information such as quotas and access
rights.

  Its interface should, in theory, work with any RFC compliant
IMAP server, but it was currently only tested against Carnegie
Mellon University's Cyrus IMAP and Mirapoint's IMAP servers.
It does a CAPABILITY check for specific extensions to see if
they are supported.
