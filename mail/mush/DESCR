The "Mail User's Shell" (MUSH) is a "Mail User Agent" (MUA) that is
designed to manage electronic mail on most UNIX systems.  That is,
mush is used by users to read mail, sort it, edit it, delete it,
or use it to act as an interface to send mail to others.  A Mail
Transport Agent (MTA) is the program which mush communicates with
that actually -delivers- mail.
