Rtunes streams files containing Apple Lossless audio data to
an Apple AirPort Express device.  If a '-' is given as the
file(s) argument, rtunes expects raw PCM audio data on stdin
and encodes it to the Apple Lossless format prior to streaming
it.  With this method it is possible to stream audio data from
any source that can output raw PCM audio data on stdout.

NOTE: the patch and mplayer helper library for this package are
untested; it is installed merely as a convenience.
