BladeEnc is a program to generate MP3 files from WAV or AIFF sound files.

Any number of WAV/AIFF-files can be specified on the command-line and you
can even use wildcards to specify more than one file at the same time. For
example will the command "BladeEnc *.wav" compress all WAV-files in the
current directory. Long filenames are supported when entering them on the
command line, but if they include space-characters you will have to enclose
them with quotation-marks ( " ).
