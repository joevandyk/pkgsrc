Xmmix is a sound mixer utility for the X Window System using the
OSF/Motif interface.  It requires the Unix Sound System (formerly
"VoxWare") sound driver by Hannu Savolainen (hannu@voxware.pp.fi)
and from 4front Technologies.  This driver is also known as the Linux
sound driver.

The NetBSD ports adds automatic updating of the mixer controls
on screen when other programs manipulate them.
