id3 is an ID3 v1.1 tag editor.  ID3 tags are traditionally put at the
end of compressed streamed audio files to denote information about the
audio contents.  Up to thirty characters of Title, Artist, and Album
information can be stored, as well as a 28-character comment,
four-digit year, track number up to 255, and an enumerated genre.
