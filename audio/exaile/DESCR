Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's AmaroK, but for
GTK+. It incorporates many of the cool things from AmaroK (and other media
players) like automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries,
lyrics fetching, artist/album information via the wikipedia, last.fm
support, optional iPod support (assuming you have python-gpod installed).
