  XMMS-Crossfade can be used to remove the gaps between two songs, or to
smoothly crossfade inbetween.  Features are:

    * Crossfading:
    * Fadein/Fadeout:
    * Continuous output:
    * Gap-Killer:
    * Automatic detection of live albums:
    * High quality:
    * Secondary effect plugin:

  Version 0.1 of XMMS-Crossfade was devised as a replacement plugin for
the original OSS-plugin that comes with XMMS.  It was talking directly to
the OSS driver.  Unfortunately, any other platforms (Solaris, AIX), that
don't support OSS, would not work this way.  As of version 0.2, it can use
existing plugins for output.  It acts as a kind of crossfading "proxy"
between XMMS and the output plugin.
