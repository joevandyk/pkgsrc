AmaroK is a media player for KDE.  There are many media players
around these days, true. What's missing from most players is a user
interface, that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many buttons
do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the
playlist? amaroK tries to be a little different, providing a simple
drag and drop interface, that really makes playlist handling easy.
