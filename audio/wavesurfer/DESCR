WaveSurfer is an Open Source tool for sound visualization and
manipulation. It has been designed to suit both novice and advanced
users. WaveSurfer has a simple and logical user interface that
provides functionality in an intuitive way and which can be adapted to
different tasks. It can be used as a stand-alone tool for a wide range
of tasks in speech research and education. Typical applications are
speech/sound analysis and sound annotation/transcription. WaveSurfer
can also serve as a platform for more advanced/specialized
applications. This is accomplished either through extending the
WaveSurfer application with new custom plug-ins or by embedding
WaveSurfer visualization components in other applications.
