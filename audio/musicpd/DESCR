Music Player Daemon allows remote access for playing music (MP3s, Ogg
Vorbis files, Flacs and AAC files) and managing playlists. It is
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides
control for music playback over a local network. It is also makes a
great desktop music player, especially if you're a console junkie,
like frontend options, or restart X often.
