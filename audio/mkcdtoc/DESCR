mkcdtoc is a small and flexible command line utility to create
toc-files for cdrdao. It reads a list of audio files and outputs a
toc-file with a track specification for each audio file. Input data
can be a raw list with one file name on each line, or an m3u play
list. The program has a modular architecture and can be extended via
plugins.  The distribution includes a few plugins that can retrieve
meta information from audio files to fill CD-TEXT blocks in the
generated toc-file. There are plugins to perform audio file to WAVE
format conversion.
