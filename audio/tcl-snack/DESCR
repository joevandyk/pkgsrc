The Snack Sound Toolkit is designed to be used with a scripting
language such as Tcl/Tk or Python. Using Snack you can create powerful
multi-platform audio applications with just a few lines of code. Snack
has commands for basic sound handling, e.g. sound card and disk
I/O. Snack also has primitives for sound visualization, e.g. waveforms
and spectrograms. It was developed mainly to handle digital recordings
of speech, but is just as useful for general audio. Snack has also
successfully been applied to other one-dimensional signals.
