xhippo is a generic playlist manager program for a variety of UNIX
sound players. It's been shown to work with mpg123, bplay, mikmod,
s3mod, tracker, xmp and timidity, and should work with more-or-less
anything that can take a filename on the command line. It is capable
of automatically deciding which player to use depending on a file's
extension; the defaults are set in a config file. It uses textual
playlist files, which are easily generated with the "find" or "locate"
utilities. xhippo's interface is very loosely modelled on the
shareware "HippoPlayer" player for the Amiga.
