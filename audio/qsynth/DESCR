Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt3
toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management
application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line
softsynths but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth.
