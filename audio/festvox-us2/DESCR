synthesis system.

This voice provides a American English male voice using the MBROLA

Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using
part of speech and local distribution of breaks.  Intonation is
provided by a CART tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour

model is also trained from data using a CART tree.
