If you wonder why it is called Infinity, the main reason is that
in some effects, trajectories of particles are suppose to look like
the symbol infinity in mathematics; and I think that in fact this
title fits quite well to this plug-in . Thanks to Inigo Olmos for
this strange idea.

The aim of this project is to make a full screen psychedelic
visualization plug-in for xmms, an X media player. The design of
light effects is inspired by Geiss and G-Force, two Winamp plug-ins.
