.Sh DESCRIPTION
The encoder and decoder software are configured to output
the coded audio bitstreams as a string of hexadecimal ascii
characters. For greater compression efficiency, compile flag,
BS_FORMAT, in common.h can be switched to configure the bitstream 
reading and writing routines to process raw binary bitstreams.
.br
The decoder program has a very crude implementation of bitstream
synchword detection. It may not be able to correctly decode valid
bitstreams which have false synchword patterns in the ancillary data
portion of the bitstream.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
The software implements levels I and II and psychophysical auditory
models I and II as described in the ISO 3-11171 rev 1 standard.
There are future plans to implement level III.
.br
The input/output audio data may either be headerless raw 16 bit data
or alternatively an AIFF formatted file (Audio Interchange File Format)
with certain limitations.
.br 
For more information on the AIFF format see the postscript file
/sgi/aiff-c.9.26.91.ps at the anonymous ftp site FTP.SGI.COM
(192.48.153.1).
.br
The AIFF formatted file is a convenient way for storing sampling rate
of the audio file.
.br
The encoder and decoder software are configured to output the coded
audio bitstreams as a string of hexadecimal ascii characters.
For greater compression efficiency, compile flag, BS_FORMAT, 
in common.h can be switched to configure the bitstream reading 
and writing routines to process raw binary bitstreams.
.br
This software has been run and verified on a large variety of
computers and operating systems. In particular UNIX, MS_DOS (with
MicroSoft C version 6), Macintosh, AIX Platform (RS6000) and Convex.
