PythonDaap is a (under development) DAAP client implemented in Python,
and based on PyTunes by Davyd Madeley.  The authentication stuff
(needed by recent copies of iTunes) has been added, and a primitive
object model that can download individual tracks, and has playlist
support.

This distribution also includes an implementation of Apple's custom
MD5 hasher as a python module.  This hasher is used in the DAAP
authentication protocol, documented by David Hammerton.
