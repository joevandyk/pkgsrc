Cdparanoia retrieves audio tracks from CDDA capable CDROM drives.
The data can be saved to a file or directed to standard output
in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw format.  Most ATAPI, SCSI and several
proprietary CDROM drive makes are supported; cdparanoia can
determine if the target drive is CDDA capable.

In addition to simple reading, cdparanoia adds extra-robust
data verification, synchronization, error handling and scratch
reconstruction capability.
