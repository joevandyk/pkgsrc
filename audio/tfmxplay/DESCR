TFMX (The Final Musicsystem eXtended) is an Amiga game music format
developed by Chris Huelsbeck. It is rather unlike the various "Module"
formats (Protracker et al.). Some of the few players for this format
are:
  * the original TFMX editor (Amiga)
  * EaglePlayer (Amiga)
  * TFMX-Play and its numerous derivatives (originally ST, now Linux and Win32)
  * the SUN-Project PMS-player (DOS, used for the PC-Version of Turrican 2)

The original editor is extremely rare, but it is available from the
ExoticA! site. The SUN-Project player is not that great (partly
because of DOS, partly because it has never been finished).
And TFMX-Play is what you're looking at right now.
