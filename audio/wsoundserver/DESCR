WSoundServer is a dockapp which interprets WindowMaker events (such as
shading a window or minimizing an application) and plays a sound associated
with that event. Since it's dockable, you can have it automatically launch
on startup, or "kill" it off if it becomes too noisy.

You can find a partial soundset for it at
