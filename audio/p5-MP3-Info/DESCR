This is MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3 files.

This release has two small bugfixes, one for better rendering of ID3v2
data in get_mp3tag, and one for dealing with some possibly broken MP3s.

A wrapper module is included so scripts calling MPEG::MP3Info (the
old name) will still work.
