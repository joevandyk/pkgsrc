The Network Audio System is designed for playing, recording, and
manipulating audio data over a network.  Like the X Window System, it
uses the client/server model to separate applications from the
specific drivers that control audio input and output devices.

Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio file and data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms
