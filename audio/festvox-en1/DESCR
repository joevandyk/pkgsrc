MBROLA based British English male voice for the festival speech
synthesis system.

This voice provides a British RP English male voice using the MBROLA
wave synthesis method (via the MBROLA package). It uses a modified
Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary for pronunciations.  Prosodic
phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using part
of speech and local distribution of breaks.  Intonation is provided
by a CART tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour generated
from a model trained from natural speech.  The duration model is
also trained from data using a CART tree.
