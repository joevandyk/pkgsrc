EasyH10 is an open source project for the development of a software suite for
iRiver H10 digital audio players. It creates the database layout for an H10
player, without the need for iRiver Plus or Windows Media Player 10, based on
music and playlist files transferred manually (e.g., drag-and-drop operation,
copy command, rsync utility, etc). EasyH10 is compatible with iriver H10 5GB,
6GB, and 20GB models shipped worldwide as well as various platforms such as
Windows 98SE/ME/2000/XP, Linux, MacOS X, and other POSIX-like operating
systems.
