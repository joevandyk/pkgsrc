Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to
output audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.

This package provides the libao's core library and support for AU
(.au) file output, Null output (does nothing), RAW sample output,
and WAV (.wav) file output.

You will have to install a libao-* plugin package in order to get
audio working.
