TunesBrowser is a simple music player, capable of playing music found
on iTunes(TM)  shares.

TunesBrowser can connect to the latest iTunes applications (as of
April 29 2004) and is implemented on top of libopendaap

TunesBrowser's interface is quite similar to that of iTunes.

TunesBrowser was written with the purpose of being a prototype
front-end for libopendaap.  I intend to integrate libopendaap with
other, more mature, players.
