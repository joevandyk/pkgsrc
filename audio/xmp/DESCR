This is the Extended Module Player, an open source module player for UNIX
distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. xmp currently runs on several
platforms, including ALSA, OSS (for Linux on i386 and Alpha and FreeBSD),
BSD, SunOS, Solaris, S/Linux and HP-UX.  On PC class machines with GUS or
AWE cards xmp takes advantage of the  OSS sequencer to play modules  with
virtually no system load. Using software mixing, xmp plays at rates up to
48 kHz in mono or stereo, 8 or 16 bits, signed or unsigned, little or big
endian samples with 32 bit linear interpolation.

The current version of xmp supports many Amiga and PC module formats
(including packed, Powerpacked and SQSHed modules) -- currently 47 known
formats.
