The main purpose of Mserv is to play songs that those in the room want
to hear. It works by each user rating the songs they hear - at the
moment this means they type rate good via telnet or click GOOD via web,
but hopefully there will be Windows/X clients available soon. Mserv
uses the ratings, the date the song was last played, the filter
settings and who is currently logged in. It then compiles a 'top' list
of songs that are most likely to be played.
