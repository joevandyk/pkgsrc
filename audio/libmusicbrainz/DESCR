MusicBrainz is a user-maintained community music metadatabase.
Music metadata is information such as the artist name, the release
title, and the list of tracks that appear on a release. MusicBrainz
collects this information about recordings and makes it available
to the public. All of the data in MusicBrainz is user contributed
and user maintained.

This library is an interface to the MusicBrainz database. It is
aimed at developers of media players, CD rippers, taggers and other
applications requiring music metadata. The service's architecture
follows the REST design principles. Interaction with the web service
is done using HTTP and all content is served in a simple but flexible
XML format.
