KMP is an Music Player Daemon client that uses the QT GUI toolkit so
it will comfortably fit in with your KDE desktop, although only QT is
required. MPD is a daemon that runs in the background and accepts
connections from clients which can then tell MPD what to do. KMP aims
to be a full featured and easy-to-use client. KMP will allow you to
browse the server's collection, add songs to the playlist, change the
volume, etc.
