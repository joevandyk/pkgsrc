If you wish to use the Audio CD playback capability of XMMS, you need
to configure XMMS in the following manner:

1. Select "Options" -> "Preferences" (or press Control-P)
2. Select "Audio I/O Plugins" tab
3. Configure "CD Audio Player ... [libcdaudio.so]"
4. Change "Device:" to the raw partition of your CD player (e.g., `/dev/cd0d').
5. Change "Directory:" to an existing (empty) directory to be used within the
   XMMS file selection dialog boxes as the path to select tracks on audio CDs
   (e.g., `/cdrom/').
6. Select "OK" to save the changes.
