With the cost of hard drive storage falling under $1 USD per GB,
storing audio in a lossless format is now inexpensive and practical.
The FLAC codec is an OpenSource and Free software of very high
quality.  The FLAC format supports meta-info as ID3v1 tags or OGG
comments.  FLAC even has plugins for popular audio players such as
XMMS and WinAMP.  This script also helps with the generation of MP3
files from FLAC, whilst preserving the tags.  This way you can easily
convert an album from FLAC to MP3 for playing on a mobile audio
device.  You will need LAME installed and in your $PATH.  Using the
script is simple:

    * cd /path/to/directory/with/FLACS
    * flac2mp3 *flac

After transcoding, you will have matching, tagged MP3 files in the
same directory.  Note:  Only use this script on flac files that you
trust to have non-malicious tags (ie, ones that you've created
yourself).
