The dynamic duo of CDDB.py and DiscID.py, along with their side-kick C
module cdrommodule.so, provide an easy way for Python programs to
fetch information on audio CDs from CDDB (http://www.cddb.com/) -- a
very large online database of track listings and other information on
audio CDs.
Note that for CDDB.py version 1.3 and later, the default CDDB servers
have changed to FreeDB, as GraceNote, the owners of the
previously-free CDDB archives, have become unreasonably restrictive
with access to their database.  See http://www.freedb.org/ for more
information on FreeDB.
