Basically, SIDPLAY is just an ordinary music player software. More
specifically, SIDPLAY emulates the Sound Interface Device chip (MOS 6581,
commonly called SID) and the Micro Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the
Commodore 64 on your computer. It is a platform independent software
emulating these hardware components. Therefore it is able to load and
execute C64 machine code programs which produce music or sound. In general
these are independent fragments of code and data which have been ripped
from games and demonstration programs and have been transferred directly
from the C64.
