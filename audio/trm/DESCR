The TRM Generator is a small test application that generates Relatable TRM
acoustic fingerprints. This tool is mainly designed as a test/debugging tool
for software developers, and is both an application and a developer library.
The developer library provides developers with the functionality to generate
TRM ids from Wav, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis files.
