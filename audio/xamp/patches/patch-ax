-1. Introduction
-
-amp (Audio Mpeg Player) is an MPEG audio decoder which I originally started 
-putting together as a side project of the MPEG hardware design project at 
-FER/Zagreb - just to confirm my knowledge of the standard. It works with
-both MPEG1 and MPEG2 audio streams (except for the multichannel extensions
-defined in MPEG2), layers 2 and 3. 
-
-There is a gui for amp, written in Tcl/Tk by Edouard Lafargue. It is 
-available at the amp home site ftp://ftp.rasip.fer.hr
-
-Another gui supported is the Sajber Jukebox, written by Joel Lindholm 
-<wizball@kewl.campus.luth.se>
-
-The following people contributed their time and knowledge to amp:
-Karl Anders Oygard, Ilkka Karvinen, Lutz Vieweg, Dan Nelson,
-Edouard Lafargue, Andrew Richards, George Colouris,
-Dmitry Boldyrev, Andy Lo A Foe, Thomas Sailer
-
-amp home location is
-	ftp://ftp.rasip.fer.hr/pub/mpeg/
-
-and the mailing list: send 'HELP' in the body of the message to:
-	multimedia@rasip.fer.hr
-
-If you want to find out more about MPEG, best places to start are
-	http://www.mpeg.org
-	http://www.mpeg2.de 
-
-
-2. Installation
-
-Installation should be simple enough if amp was ported to your system,
-just do a 
-
-./configure
-make 
-
-You can edit the makefile further to suit your system. If configure fails 
-to make a usable Makefile, you'll _have_ to edit it yourself.
-
-Linux users should try real-time playing support, as described
-in doc/realtime.txt. Some people that might pass on this feature are
-those with slower machines (i.e. 486's), or SMP systems (see the
-doc/linuxrealtime.txt file). 
-Some versions of the linux C library produce an error when compiling
-amp with realtime support. A quick fix is to edit /usr/include/sched.h
-and replace _P in the offending line with __P.
-
-./configure --enable-realtime
-make
-chown root.root amp
-chmod u+s amp
-
-
-3. Running:
-
-'amp -h' gives you usage & options. If your computer is on the slower
-side, direct playback might not work, but you can decode it
-to .wav or raw pcm and play it later.
-
-
-4. Feedback
-
-Send in your makefiles, opinions, bugreports, fixes; anything related to this
-program. You can also send me unlimited amounts of money, sugar, milk, etc.
-
-If you find any mpeg audio files that amp has trouble decoding, please tell
-me about this via e-mail <tuzelac@rasip.fer.hr>.
-
-
-5. Contributing
-
-Please contribute to amp. If you want to know what is going on in amp 
-development, you can join the developers mailing list
-
-	mpeg_audio_developers@rasip.fer.hr
-
-There are certain debugging facilities that I made in amp, but are disabled
-in the current release (they are neither nice nor user-friendly). If anyone
-enhances them (they are in dump.c) to the point that they're actually
-usable I'll be happy to include the changes in the release. I think this
-kind of debug output would be very useful to people studying these audio
-algorithms.

-when a modest distribution fee is charged for the CD, as long as this
