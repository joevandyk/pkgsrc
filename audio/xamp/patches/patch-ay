-WHAT IS IT?
-
-Xamp is a version of amp plus a gui. Read the regular README on info about
-amp. It was developed on an cx86 running Linux, so it should be pretty
-portable. It doesn't take much cpu time; if your computer can run regular
-amp, it'll probably run Xamp.
-
-INSTALLING
-
-You'll need Qt (+include files), libX11 (+include files), a properly set up
-X server somewhere and a properly configured sound driver.
-
-$ tar xzvvf xamp-0.8.tgz
-# be carefull here. You need to enter the xamp-0.8/ directory again otherwise 
-# you will get just the command line amp.
-$ cd xamp-0.8/xamp-0.8/
-$ ./configure
-
-should take care of most configuration issues. I don't know autoconf very
-well, but I think what I added to amp's script works pretty well. Then just
-run make and you will get a binary called xamp. Just execute that and have
-fun with Xamp.
-
-DEBIAN USERS INSTALL (i386 only)
-    
-You can get a deb packet insted of the source or binary to install on a
-debian linux system. The install from here it is really easy. All you need
-is that you have installed qt properly and then just as root type
-
-# dpkg -i xamp_0.8-1_i386.deb
-    
-the filaname can be different, depends on the Xamp version.
-    
-REDHAT USERS INSTALL (i386 only)
-	
-There is a rpm of the package as well. For those with RedHat just get the
-xamp binary in the rpm format and execute as root
-
-# rpm -ivh xamp-0.8-1.i386.rpm
-
-the filaname can be different, depends on the Xamp version.
-
-RUNNING
-
-The program pretty much speaks for itself. There is a playlist from which
-the player plays. you can specify the initial list on the commandline (eg.
-$ xamp ~/mp3s/TypeO*mp3) or start empty. Click on the 'LOAD' button to get
-to the playlist editor. You can add new files, delete them and move items
-around by dragging. You can save the playlist to a flat textfile (one line
-per item) and you can load such files. Doubleclick on an item to make the
-player play that item.
-
-The main screen has regular previous, play/pause, stop and next
-buttons. there's also a shuffle and repeat togglebutton. You'll figure it out.
-
-There is an option added now that you can put a background in
-/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xamp/ as a file back.bmp (i did tested it just with
-bitmaps, but it should work with pixmaps as well..). The one and only
-problem is that the filename must be in that exact path with name back.bmp
-	  
-SHORTCUTS
-    
-In new versions of Xamp there are shortcuts for all the main functions that
-Xamp supports.
-    
-Here are the shortcuts and the description for the command
-    Z - Rewind
-    X - Play/Pause
-    C - Stop
-    V - Fast forward
-    N - Mono/Stero adjustments
-    M - Mute
-    S - Shuffle mode playing
-    R - Repeat the song
-    UpKey - Incrase volume
-    DownKey - Decrase volume
-    LeftKey - Balance to left
-    RightKey - Balance to right
-    A - About dialog
-    ALT + Q - Quit
-
-    Double click on the song label opens the id3 tag editor
-    
-There are some in the playlist editor, but those shortcuts characters are
-underlined and you can connect with ALT+key.
-
-PROBLEMS
-
-if it dumps core, please send a patch or a detailed bugreport (don't attach
-the mp3!). this version seems pretty solid compared to the last, but I know
-I'm not a very good tester.
-
-xamp will refuse to play some weird (but compliant, according to the
-standard) mp3's, like ones that change bitrates halfway through or strange
-bitrates I couldn't reproduce here. the problem is that the function that
-gets called after you pull the slider needs to calculate where it should go
-in the mp3 stream. there are some magic values involved that calculation. I
-can't find out those values for weird bitrates I can't reproduce here, and I
-don't even want to think about the bitrate-switching streams.
-
-it was either keeping tabs on offsets while playing (slow & irritating,
-especially when seeking forward) or an ugly seeking function with a lot of
-magic values. the ugly function does seem to work for most cases, so I stuck
-with it. _if_ you should encounter an mp3 xamp won't play, email me.

-
-BUGS
-
-I know about that quit bug. If somebody does solve that thing please
-just report to me how I should get rid of it.. Thanx.
-The playlist Length thing.. I dont know for now how to implement that length
-of the playlist, so I consider it a bug.
-Other bug reports are welcome!
-As a ID3 TAG editor was added.. you might encounter some problems.. not
-yet fully tested.
-    
-TODO
-
- - stuff warnings (and errors?) into a messagebox
- - multiple selection in the playlist editor
- - some sort of bouncy fft or osciloscope graph.

-Legal addendum to the amp README:
-
-everything in this package that is not in the original amp package this

-you give credit where credit is due. clearly.
