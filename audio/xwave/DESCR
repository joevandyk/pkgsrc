xwave is an audio player, recorder and editor for the X Window System.

This is an alpha release of xwave.

The user interface of xwave is based on the Athena Widget Set and some
Widgets from FWF. The application defaults are optimized to work with
Xaw3d (replaces the Xaw for 3d look), so if you don't use Xaw3d you will
probably need to modify the resources.

Features:
	- multiple files
	- overview window
	- zoom window
	- mark, cut, copy, paste, merge
	- echo, reverse, swap, resample, volume (absolute, dynamic
	  compressor)
	- stop record on demand
	- raw, wav, au, aiff, aifc (PCM,ALAW,ULAW,ADPCM <- not all
	  implementations)
	- files of every length
