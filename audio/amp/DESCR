------------------------ From the README file ------------------------
amp (Audio Mpeg Player) is an MPEG audio decoder which I originally started
putting together as a side project of the MPEG hardware design project at
FER/Zagreb - just to confirm my knowledge of the standard. It works with
both MPEG1 and MPEG2 audio streams (except for the multichannel extensions
defined in MPEG2), layer3 only for now.
