MBROLA is a speech synthesizer based on the concatenation of
diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input, together with prosodic
information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear description
of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear), at the
sampling frequency of the diphone database.

It is therefore NOT a Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesizer, since it does
not accept raw text as input.  In order to obtain a full TTS system,
you need to use this synthesizer in combination with a text processing
system that produces phonetic and prosodic commands.

This software is the heart of the MBROLA project, the aim of which is
to obtain a set a speech synthesizers for as many languages as
possible, free of use for non-commercial applications.

As such, it requires an MBROLA language/voice database to run
properly.  American English, Brazilian Portuguese, Breton, British
English, Croatian, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Romanian, Spanish and
Swedish voices are made available. Additional languages and voices
will be available in the context of the MBROLA project.

Some of these voices are available as mbrolavox-* packages, in the
NetBSD packages system. For others, please consult the mbrola
project's home page.
