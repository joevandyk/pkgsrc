LiveIce is the source client for Icecast which encodes an mpeg
stream for broadcast as it is created. Unlike clients such as Shout
and IceDJ this permits the broadcast of live audio, rather than
prerecorded mp3's.

To start:
 0. start icecast
 1. find $HOME/mp3 -type f >playlist
 2. liveiceconfigure.tk, save
 3. In /bin/sh: liveice -M 2>/dev/null
