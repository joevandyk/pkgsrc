GramoFile is able to record hours of CD quality music, split long
sound files in separate tracks, and remove ticks and pops from
recordings.  It can be used for ripping audio from vinyl LPs.

+ Integrated sound recording and playback (with customized versions of
  brec(1) and bplay(1) by David Monro);
+ Handling of large sound files up to a few GB;
+ Signal peak level meter during recording;
+ Playback of user-specifiable parts of sound files;
+ Signal processing through application of `filters';
+ Nine filters (filter types, actually) are supplied, new ones can be
  added fairly easily;
+ Multiple filters can be used, in random order, in one single run - even
  multiple instances of the same filter;
+ Most filters can be fine-tuned through a number of parameters
  (independent of each filter instance);
+ A large sound file containing an entire side of a gramophone record can
  be split into separate sound files, one for each track;
+ Signal processing and track splitting are performed simultaneously;
+ Text mode user interface with a windows-like look and `feel';
+ Sound files of the familiar .wav type are used
