'rio' is a simple command line utility which allows you to display and
manage files on your Diamond Rio portable music player.

At present the Rio utility supports the Diamond Rio PMP300 with 32M
internal flash memory.  Additional external flash memory is now
supported thanks to the work done by Guido March
(march@pc40.mpier.uni-frankfurt.de).
