eMixer is a front-end to mpg123 that allows you to
play and mix two mp3 streams together. This ability
to mix two mp3s together makes eMixer act like a
cross-fader effectively giving the user DJ like
capabilities from their computer console. eMixer is
also very able in a "real time" party environment.
