DAP is a comprehensive audio sample editing and processing suite. DAP
currently supports AIFF, AIFF-C, WAV and RAW audio files, 8 or 16 bit
resolution and 1, 2 or 4 channels of audio data. Note however that compressed
AIFF-C files are not currently supported, only non-compressed AIFF-C files.

The package itself offers comprehensive editing, playback and recording
facilities including full time stretch resampling, manual data editing and a
reasonably complete DSP processing suite. Note however that time stretching
does not currently work on Solaris (still trying to debug !!).

For compatibility with sox, the popular audio conversion tool, the "Sox
Compatible" preference must be switched on in DAP. Switching this option on
simply tells DAP not to save any strings when saving AIFF files. This is
necessary as the current version of sox is rather buggy and doesn't like odd
length strings. I'm gonna try and check in a fix to sox but for now if you have
any problems converting using sox switch this option on.
