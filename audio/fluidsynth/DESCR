FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2
specifications. FluidSynth can read MIDI events from a MIDI input
device and render them to an audio device using SoundFont instruments.
SoundFont files are composed of digital audio "samples" and additional
instrument parameters. These files can be created or downloaded off the
Internet. FluidSynth also has support for controlling effects in real
time and can play MIDI files.

Note: FluidSynth was previously called IIWU Synth.
