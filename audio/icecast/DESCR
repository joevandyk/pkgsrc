Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
relatively easily and it supports open standards for communication
and interaction.
