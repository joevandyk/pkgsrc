DarkIce is an IceCast, IceCast2 and ShoutCast live audio streamer. It takes
audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and/or Ogg Vorbis, and sends
the streams to one or more IceCast, ShoutCast and/or IceCast2 servers. DarkIce
uses lame as a shared object as its mp3 encoder, and the Ogg Vorbis libs as its
Ogg Vorbis encoder.
