Castilian Spanish male voice for the festival speech synthesis system.

This voice provides a Castilian Spanish male voice using a residual
excited LPC diphone synthesis method.  The lexicon is provided by
a set of letter to sound rules producing pronunciation accents and
syllabification.  The durations, intonation and prosodic phrasing
are minimal but are acceptable for simple examples.
