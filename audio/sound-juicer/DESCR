Sound Juicer is a simple and clean CD ripping tool. It allows you
to extract the audio from audio compact discs and convert them into audio
files that your computer can understand and play.  Sound Juicer can also
play the audio tracks directly from the CD, allowing you to preview the
CD before ripping it.
