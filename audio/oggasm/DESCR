Oggasm is a program that makes converting your mp3 collection into oggs
at all but painless process. Using oggenc and mpg321(or mpg123), with perl
glueing it all together, oggasm is able to go through an entire collection,
identify id3 tags and then convert those mp3s into oggs while keeping
the id3 tags intact.
