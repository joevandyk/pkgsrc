LMMS aims to be a free alternative to popular (but commercial and
closed- source) programs like FruityLoops, Cubase and Logic giving you
the ability of producing music with your computer by
creating/synthesizing sounds, arranging samples, using effects, playing
live with keyboard and much more...

LMMS combines the features of a sequencer-program (pattern-/channel-/
sample-/song-/effect-management) and those of powerful synthesizers and
samplers in a modern, user-friendly and easy to use graphical
user-interface.
