FAAD2 is the fastest ISO AAC audio decoder available. FAAD2 correctly
decodes all MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 MAIN, LOW, LTP, LD and ER object type
AAC files.

There is a stable version of FAAD2 available, source code can be
downloaded on the download page. The advantage of this new library
is the lack of copyrighted code written by third parties. Further
it is coded much cleaner and will give a much better understanding
of the AAC coding algorithms.
