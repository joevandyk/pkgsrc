MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX
designed to be powerful and easy to use. Noteworthy features
include:

  * By default, files are decoded and played in a background
    process. This allows the user to quit the interface (e.g.,
    if one needs to close the xterm) without affecting
    playback. It also allows attaching multiple interfaces
    (e.g. in multiple xterms) to the same player.
  * Playback should be smooth even under high cpu or I/O load,
    due to the use of output buffering in a separate thread.
  * There are no sound gaps in between files, because the next
    file to be played is precached while playing the current
    file.

Note: To avoid conflicts with Qt's 'moc', the moc binary is
called 'mocp'.
