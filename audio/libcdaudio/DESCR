  libcdaudio is a multi-platform CD player development library which
works with NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and Irix. It
includes a basic command set for controlling the operation of the
CD-ROM drive as well as functions for accessing both the CDDB, CD
Index, and Cover Art Index.

  It is recommended that all programs wishing to specifically use CDDB
data use the FreeDB at "http://www.freedb.org/", which works well with
libcdaudio.

  The CD Index ("http://www.cdindex.org/") is a rethought track
information management system that uses SQL servers to manage the data.
This is another track information method libcdaudio is capable of
using.

  The Cover Art Index ("http://coverart.undergrid.net/") provides a
method of locating cover art for a particular CD based upon the disc's
name or CD Index ID.

  The entire libcdaudio API may be found in the libcdaudio
programmer's manual at "http://cdcd.undergrid.net/libcdaudio/manual/".
The interface to the given functions will remain as they are
specified, although new functions may continue to be added.
