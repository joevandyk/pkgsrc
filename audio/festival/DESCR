Festival is an advanced multi-lingual speech synthesis system
developed at CSTR. It offers a full text to speech system with various
APIs, as well an environment for development and research of speech
synthesis techniques. It is written in C++ with a Scheme-based command
interpreter for general control.

You will also need to install at least one festvox-* (festival voice)
package (infact, the festvox packages are dependent on this package).

festival --tts foo.bar will speak ASCII file foo.bar, (SayText "Oh
Dad! We're ALL Devo!")
