This is a text to speech system produced by integrating various pieces
of code and tables of data, which are all (I believe) in the public domain.

The Oxford Text Archive has for several years maintained copies of several
machine-readable dictionaries along with its extensive (if
unsystematic) collections of other machine-readable texts. This document
gives some further details of the various dictionaries available, and
summarises the conditions under which copies of them are currently
distributed.

The Oxford Text Archive Shortlist  (available on request via electronic
mail and by FTP) gives up to date brief details of all texts held in
the Archive. Send electronic mail to ARCHIVE@VAX.OXFORD.AC.UK. For
anonymous FTP, look in the directory ota on ota.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165)
