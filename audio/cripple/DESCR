Cripple is a simple command line CD ripper wrapper.  It uses audio/cdparanoia,
misc/libcdio or sysutils/cdrtools to rip, and audio/lame or audio/bladeenc to
encode tracks from a CD.

Cripple retrieves naming information for filenames and ID3 tags from the freedb
(CDDB) or local xmcd/CDDB format files, which it can write.  CDDB access is
implemented via HTTP and works through proxies.  There is built-in support for
writing ID3v1.1 tags to output files.
