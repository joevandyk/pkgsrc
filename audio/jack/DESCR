JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant
operating systems such as GNU/Linux and Apple's OS X. It can connect a
number of different applications to an audio device, as well as allowing
them to share audio between themselves. Its clients can run in their own
processes (ie. as normal applications), or can they can run within the
JACK server (ie. as a "plugin").
