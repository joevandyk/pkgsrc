GNOME VFS provides an abstraction layer of the file system; applications
use this layer to access many different protocols and simulate that they
are part of the local file system.

This package provides the cdda module for GNOME VFS, which allows it to
retrieve audio tracks from CDDA capable CDROM drives.
