Paranormal is an extremely customizable (pseudo-programmable)
visualization plugin for the X MultiMedia System, based (conceptually)
on Winamp's AVS plugin.  The goal of Paranormal is to be as flexible as
possible by providing a number of 'actuators' that perform various
tasks involved in generating an image.  These actuators can then be
combined to create a nearly unlimited number of effects.  These
combinations can be saved to a file to be brought back later or
distributed to your friends.
