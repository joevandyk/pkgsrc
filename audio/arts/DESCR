The Analog Real-Time Synthesizer, or aRts, is a modular system for synthesizing
sound and music on a digital computer. Using small building blocks called
modules, the user can easily build complex audio processing tools. Modules
typically provide functions such as sound waveform generators, filters, audio
effects, mixing, and playback of digital audio in different file formats.
