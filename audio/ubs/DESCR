The Uninterrupted Broadcasting System (UBS) is a program designed to run the
operations of a radio station when a DJ isn't in house. This includes playing
station ID's, public service announcements, and songs. This program is
similar in function (but not design nor implementation) to DRS 2006.

The UBS was not intended to be used for webcasting, but it could presumably
be adapted for this purpose. The intended audience of the UBS is smaller
college/high school/commercial radio stations which wish to do unattended
broadcasting via a stable and reliable computer daemon.
