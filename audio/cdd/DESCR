CDD is as the name implies, an attempt at a DD utility for CD's of all
flavors.  CDD will do its best to copy CD audio data, CD-ROM data in both
raw and "cooked" forms to a directory of the users choice.

CDD doesn't support every CD-ROM drive, though it supports many common
ones, including those that support the new MMC command set.
