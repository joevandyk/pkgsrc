terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch"
on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.ogg, *.mp3, etc.) the way
hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple turntables,
realtime effects (buit-in as well as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer
and MIDI interface - all accessible through an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.
