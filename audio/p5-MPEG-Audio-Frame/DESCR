A very simple, pure Perl module which allows parsing out data from MP3 files
or streams and chunking them up into different frames.  You can use this to
accurately determine the length of an MP3, filter non-audio data, or chunk up
the file for streaming via datagram.  Virtually anything is possible.

This module supports MPEG-1, MPEG-2 Multichannel, MPEG-2 LSF and MPEG-2.5.
