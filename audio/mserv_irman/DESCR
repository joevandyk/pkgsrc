mserv_irman allows easy control of the 'mserv' mp3 jukebox program
using ordinary remote controls and irman receivers from evation.com.

mserv already allows rating of tracks to allow the system to pick
tracks appropriate to who is currently connected. mserv_irman works
with this to permit relatively peaceful sharing of an mp3 jukebox
in an office of widely disparate tastes.
