Xine is a free multimedia player library for playing back CDs, DVDs,
and VCDs.  It also decodes multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3
from local disk drives, and displays multimedia streamed over the
Internet.  It interprets many of the most common multimedia formats
available -- and some of the most uncommon formats, too.

This package provides the esound audio output plugin for xine-lib.
