Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/kronolith/INSTALL

on how to setup your Kronolith installation. You need to at least edit

	${PREFIX}/share/horde/config/registry.php

to enable Kronolith in the horde framework.  You will also need to configure
Kronolith by using the Horde administrative interface.

Finally you will also need to make Kronolith accessible through your HTTP
server.  If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following
lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/kronolith.conf
