"Pcal" Version 4.7

This is a new release of "Pcal", the PostScript calendar program.  The major
new features are the "-H" flag for generating output in HTML table form,
expansion of "%y" in the "include" filename into the last two digits of
every applicable year in "year all" mode, and the addition of build-time
support for A4 size paper.
