XDaliClock is a digital clock for the X Window System; when a digit changes,
it ``melts'' into its new shape.

It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and displays the date when a mouse
button is held down.  It has two large fonts built into it, but it can
animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.  It can also do some
funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use overlay planes or the `shape'
extension so that the window is transparent.
