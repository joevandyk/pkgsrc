A C extension package for python that provides new datatypes for
handling dates and times together with a rich set of conversion and
parsing routines.

These types were created to provide a consistent way of transferring
date and time data between Python and databases. Apart from handling
date before the Unix epoch (1.1.1970) they also correctly work with
dates beyond the Unix time limit (currently with Unix time value being
encoded using 32bit integers, the limit is reached in 2038) and thus
is Year 2000 and Year 2038 safe.
