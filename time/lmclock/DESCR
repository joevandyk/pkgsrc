This is a clock program inspired by one I saw on a Lisp machine several
years ago.  I really liked it and didn't know of anything for X like it,
so I wrote this really quickly one day and posted it to alt.sources.

This program may be redistributed freely.  If you make any improvements,
please feel free to send them to me at smar@reptiles.org.
