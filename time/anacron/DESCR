Anacron is a periodic command scheduler.  It executes commands at intervals
specified in days.  Unlike cron, it does not assume that the system is running
continuously.  It can therefore be used to control the execution of daily,
weekly and monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
do not run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly, Anacron
will make sure that the commands are run at the specified intervals as closely
as machine-uptime permits.
