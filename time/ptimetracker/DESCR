PTimeTracker is a small Qt-based program that helps you keep track
of the time spent on projects. The time in minutes spent on the
active project is displayed on the icon and title bar and therefore
viewable even when the program is minimised. A detailed report is
available on total hours worked on different projects. This report
displays the amount of time spent on each of the projects per day.
