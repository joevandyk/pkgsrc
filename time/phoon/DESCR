phoon - program to display the PHase of the mOON.  Unlike other
such programs, which just tell you how long since first quarter
or something like that, phoon *shows* you the phase with a little
picture.  I've put an example at the end of this file.  I first
wrote this program in Pascal / TOPS-20 at CMU in 1979; I translated
it to Ratfor / Software Tools in 1981; and now it's in C / Unix.
