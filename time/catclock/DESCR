This version of xclock is a Motif-based variant of the MIT xclock
program, with an alarm feature, and a new "cat" mode, in addition to
the analog and digital modes.  The cat image was based on the famous
"Kit-Cat" (R) plastic wall clock, and was designed by Deanna Hohn of
DEC Advanced Technology Development.  The Motif interface, eyes,
tails, and the general state of the program now are a product of
Philip Schneider of DEC.
