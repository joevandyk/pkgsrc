+.SH DESCRIPTION
+WMTime displays the time and date and gives you some nice additional
+features too. It is intended for docking in WindowMaker.
+
+WMTime currently provides:
+
+  * Time and date;
+  * Realtime morphing UI (analog <> digital mode);
+  * Autoscaling and anti aliased hands;
+  * Locale, can display DAY and DATE in various languages;
+  * Can launch 3 user definable commands through ~/.wmtimerc;
+  * Can be run multiple times;
+  * Commandline options for help (-h), version (-v), digital
+    clock mode (-digital) and and display (-d)
+
+WMTime can lauch 3 user definable commands for left, middle and
+right mouse button clicks, which you can define in ~/.wmtimerc,
+
+left: mycommand-1 &
+
+middle: mycommand-2 &
+
+right: mycommand-3 &
+
+If wmtime detects a ~/.wmtimerc file, it will launch your defined
+command(s) when you click in the clock display area.
+
+WMtime can realtime 'morph' it's UI from analog <> digital,
+simply left click in either the DAY or DATE gadget ;-)
+
+Be sure to drag WMTime on it's outer edges, WMTime is a bit picky 
+due to the large gfx pixmap it keeps ;-)
