wxRemind is a graphical front-end to Remind, a remarkably sophisticated
calendar and alarm system. wxRemind is similar to Wyrd but is based
on wxPython rather than curses. The display features a calendar
and daily event list suitable for visualizing your schedule at a
glance. Dates and associated events can be quickly selected either
with the mouse or cursor keys, and dates in the calendar are color
coded to reflect the total duration of scheduled events. wxRemind
provides an internal editor or integrates with an external editor
of your choice to make editing of reminder files more efficient,
provides hotkeys to quickly access the most common Remind options,
allows popup, sound and/or spoken alerts and can display a postscript
calendar of the selected month suitable for printing.
