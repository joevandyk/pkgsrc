The DateTime::Event::Cron module generates DateTime and DateTime::Set objects
based on crontab-style entries.  The crontab formats are the extended V7
standard as described in crontab(5) on linux systems and as noted in the
documentation for Set::Crontab.

Note that the module is still alpha status.  Methods provided are likely to
change in the future.
