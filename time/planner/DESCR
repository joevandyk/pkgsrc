Planner is a project management tool for the GNOME desktop.  Among other
things, it provides:

- Task managment: define a list of tasks to accomplish a project, the
  dependencies among them and their lengths.  Of course, you can view a
  Gantt chart from this data.

- Resource management: define a list of resources for your project and
  assign them to tasks.

- Calendar management: create different calendars for the human resources
  in your project so that tasks can be automatically scheduled according
  to their calendars.
