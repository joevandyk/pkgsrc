Plan is a schedule planner based on X/Motif. It displays a month calendar
similar to xcal, but every day box is large enough to show appointments in
small print. By pressing on a day box, the appointments for that day can be
listed and edited. Appointments are entered with the following information:

- the date, time, and length (time and days) of the appointment,
- an optional text message and an optional script to be executed,
- early-warn and late-warn triggers that precede the alarm time
- repetitions: [n-th] weekdays, days-of-the-month, every n days, yearly
- optional fast command-line appointment entry
- flexible ways to specify holidays and vacations
- extensive context help
- multiuser capability using an IP server program (with access lists),
- grouping of appointments into files, per-user, private, and others

The action being taken when a warn or alarm time is reached is programmable;
by default a window pops up. In addition, a program can be executed, or mail
can be sent. Other methods of listing appointments (today, this week, next
week, or a keyword search for regular expressions) are also available. Plan
can be configured to display times in 12-hour or 24-hour formats, mmddyy and
ddmmyy date formats, and can show either Monday or Sunday in the leftmost
column. Four view modes are supported: month, year, week, day, and a 365-day
overview. The day, week, and overview plot appointments as colored and
labeled bars on a time chart.
