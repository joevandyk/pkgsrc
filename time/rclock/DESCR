Rclock is an analog clock for X intended as an xclock(1) replacement that
conserves memory and has extra features:  rclock enters reverse video if
there is mail waiting; an appointment reminder is also builtin.

The ~/.rclock file lists the messages to display and/or the programs
to run at specified times and dates.
