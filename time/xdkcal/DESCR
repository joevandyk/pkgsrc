X Desktop Calendar (xdkcal) is a calendar for the X Window System: it simply
draws a calendar on your desktop.  You can customize its fontset, its color
and/or its drawing style.  This application is completely internationalized,
so that it reads the locale database and draws locale specific strings, such
as the name of months or weeks.
