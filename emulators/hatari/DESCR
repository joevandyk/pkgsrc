Hatari is an Atari ST emulator for systems supported by the SDL library.

Hatari is based on two main sources:
- The WinSTon sourcecode written by Paul Bates
  (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/)
- The UAE's CPU core (http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/)

You need a copy of an Atari ST TOS ROM to use this program. Then run
the program as follows:	hatari --tos tos.image
