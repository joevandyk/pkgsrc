PC Emulator for Unix and X Windows

As the title suggests, this is a Unix/X windows program which is
designed to emulate a standard 8086 based PC.

The emulator runs at about 8-10MHz 80286 speed on a Sun SparcStation
10/40 (without the -mviking flag) and at about 6MHz 8088 speed on a
33MHz 80486 box running Linux.

I have included a Postscript representation of my project report. It's
a bit out of date now, but it's the closest thing I've got to
documentation!  I'll do some kind of latex thing for the next
release....

The program rather hogs the cpu but unmapping the window (iconifying
it) will put it to sleep.
