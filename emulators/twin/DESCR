Willows TWIN is a GNU software package for emulating the Microsoft
Win32 API.  It consists of a library set and an emulator program.  The
emulator program allows the execution of Windows binary applications
on supported platforms; using the native Intel x86 processors, or
through the built-in instruction set interpreter.  The native
libraries allow programmers natively to build Win32 and MFC
applications from source code.
