The Hewlett-Packard IA-64 instruction set simulator for Linux/x86

To get the ski to run on NetBSD/i386, you need the following:

compat_linux support in the kernel:
	http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-linux.html
procfs support in the kernel:
	http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-linux.html#chap-linux-emulating-procfs
mount /dev/pts:
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2004/11/08/0016.html

Tip: You can run the ski emulator with qemu usermode emulation on
non-i386 platforms.

Run the ski binary from within an xterm window.

BUGS: the xserver version xski doesn't currently work.
