Please refer to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/atari800 for the distribution documents.
A man page has also been installed. The system wide configuration file can
be found at ${PREFIX}/share/atari800/atari800.cfg which you will probably
want to copy to your home directory, at some stage, to personalise the
settings.

For more information please visit http://atari800.atari.org
or the news group "comp.sys.atari.8bit".

The ROM's for the Atari computers are, unfortunately, copyright. This
port uses the ROM files distributed with another freeware Atari emulator
for DOS called PC Xformer 2.5. If you would like to take a further look
at XF2.5 you can find it in your distfiles directory. For more information
on this emulator check out http://www.emulators.com/xformer.htm .
