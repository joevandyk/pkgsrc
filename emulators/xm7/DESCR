XM7 is the X11 based emulator of FM-7, which was the very
popular personal computer in Japan at 8-bits age.  It has a
built-in ROM BASIC, two M6809 microprocessors, and many other
good features.  It was produced by FUJITSU LIMITED.

You must own a real machine and make required ROM files from
it to run FM-7 software on it.  But it'd be rather difficalt
in these days.
