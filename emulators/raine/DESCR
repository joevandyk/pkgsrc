Raine is an emulator, it emulates some M68000 and M68020 arcade games and is
mainly focused on Taito and Jaleco games hardware. It started as an experiment
with the Rainbow Islands romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate
many nice games now, including new additions from Cave and other companies.
