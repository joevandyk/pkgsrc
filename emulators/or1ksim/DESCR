Or1ksim is a generic OpenRISC 1000 architecture simulator capable of
emulating OpenRISC based computer systems.  Or1ksim provides several
unique features:

    * Free, open source code
    * High level, fast, architecture simulation that allows early code
      analysis and system performance evaluation
    * All major models of OpenCores peripheral and system controller
      cores supported
    * Easy addition of new peripheral models
    * Remote debugging through a network socket with the GNU Debugger (GDB)
    * Support for different environments (memory configurations and
      sizes, OR1K processor model, configuration of peripheral
      devices)
