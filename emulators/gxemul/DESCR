GXemul is a machine emulator. The initial goal was to write a simple
64-bit MIPS emulator for running multiprocessor experiments with a
microkernel, but the emulator can be used for many other things. While
some simulators only simulate a CPU, GXemul also simulates other
hardware components, making it possible to use the emulator to run
unmodified operating systems, such as NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux.
