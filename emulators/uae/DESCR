UAE allows you to run most of the available Amiga software. It is a software
emulation, meaning that no extra or special hardware is needed to do this.
The hardware of an Amiga is emulated accurately, so that Amiga software is
tricked into thinking it is running on the real thing, with your computer's
display, keyboard, harddisk and mouse taking the parts of their emulated
counterparts.
