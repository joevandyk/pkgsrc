This is a modified version of Generator by James Ponder based on
version 0.35 and maintained by Christian Biere.

Additional features

    * Support for BZIP2, GZIP and ZIP compressed ROMs i.e., no more
      manual decompression or wasted disk space. Yay!
    * Support for X11's XVideo hardware acceleration by SDL for
      faster and smoother graphics.
    * Fullscreen support with or without the classic color frame.
    * SDL audio support (in favour of OSS Audio) which means you can
      use ESound and others for sharing the sound device among other
      applications.
    * Optional mute playing i.e., if you don't have a soundcard or
      the soundcard is busy you can still play.
    * Support for 48kHz sample rate (needs driver support).
    * Automagic CPU usage reduction which is especially cool for
      notebooks. The unpatched Generator uses more or less as much CPU
      as it can get even if needs far less than 10% on any modern system.
    * Working support for Game Genie codes.
