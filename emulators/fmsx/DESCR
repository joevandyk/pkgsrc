MSX is an old Z80-based family of home computers which appeared in
1982 as an attempt to establish a single standard in home computing
similar to VHS in video. They were popular in Asian (Korea, Japan) and
South American (Brazil, Chile) countries as well as in Europe
(Netherlands, France, Spain) and former Soviet Union, but they are
virtually unknown in USA. Although MSX standard quietly died to year
1988, the world got to see MSX2, MSX2+, and TurboR extensions of the
standard.
