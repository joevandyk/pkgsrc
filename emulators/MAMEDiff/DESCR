MAMEDiff makes it easy to identify ROM related changes in a new
release of MAME (it can even find game additions that aren't
mentioned in whatsnew.txt). It can spot game renames and will not
regard them as one game deleted and another added. When ROMs or
games are renamed (or if there is a change in the way that sets
are merged), MAMEDiff will just tell you how to rebuild the affected
sets (i.e. no downloading required). A must-have for any MAME
fanatic! It also works for new releases of MESS, RAINE, Final Burn
Alpha, Kawaks, etc.
