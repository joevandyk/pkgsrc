Palm OS Emulator is an emulator for hardware capable of running the Palm OS
operating system, with an X based interface.

To use the emulator you must obtain a ROM image of the Palm OS operating
system.  If you have a Palm OS device, you can extract the ROM image directly.

Read "UsingPalmOSEmulator.pdf" for details of how to extract ROM images and
how to use the emulator.  Run "pose" to start the emulator.
