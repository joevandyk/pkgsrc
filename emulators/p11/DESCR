P11 is a PDP11 emulator, which currently emulates the following
configuration:

        - a KDJ11A processor (including fpp)
        - one or more RL-controllers (RLV12) with up to 4 RL02 each
        - one or more RHV?? controllers with up to 8 RP06 each
        - an RK11-controller with 22-bit addressing (hey ever saw one?)
        - a MRV12 option (boot-rom/maintenance and display register)
        - one or more KL11A controllers with up to 4 serial lines each
        - a standard printer interface
        - a read only TM11 tape
        - a DEQNA ethernet adapter
        - a toy clock

On a 900MHz Athlon under FreeBSD 5.0 a 'make build; make installsrc'
of 2.11BSD takes around 2:24 hours - this is several times faster than
a real KDJ11A (if /usr is mounted async,noaccesstime).  Floating point
speed is in the order of 10 times the original.

P11 successfully runs RSX11M-PLUS, UN*X Version 5/6/7, 2.11BSD, RT-4
and XXDP.
