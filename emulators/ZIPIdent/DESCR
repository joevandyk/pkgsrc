ZIPIdent has been created to assist in the management of unemulated
or 'needed soon' ROM collections. Anyone who possesses such a
collection (emu developers for example) may find it difficult to
spot games that become emulated and then remove them from the
unemulated collection. ZIPIdent will identify ZIPs that should not
be classified unemulated and if desired will even move them out of
the 'unemulated' collection and into a separate directory.

It is quite similar to MAME's '-romident' function except for the
fact that it processes entire ROM collections, not just an individual
ZIP. ZIPIdent probably has some additional logic that '-romident'
doesn't contain too (not checked).
