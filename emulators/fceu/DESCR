FCE Ultra is an NTSC and PAL Famicom/NES emulator for various
platforms. It is based upon Bero's original FCE source code. Current
features include good PPU, CPU, pAPU, expansion chip, and joystick
emulation. Also a feature unique to this emulator (at the current
time) is authentic Game Genie emulation. Save states and snapshot
features also have been implemented.
