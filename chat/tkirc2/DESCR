tkirc is a frontend for unix's ircII (shell-client for the Internet
Relay Chat) based on Tcl/Tk.  If you know how to use ircII, you should
not have any problems to use tkirc after installation.

See /usr/pkg/share/doc/tkirc/README for more information.

Also, copy /usr/pkg/share/doc/tkirc/tkircrc-example to $HOME/.tkircrc.
