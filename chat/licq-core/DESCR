Licq is a multi-threaded ICQ clone written mostly in C++. It uses
an extensive plugin system to manage many different functions. The
main gui is written using the Qt widget set. Licq is distributed
under GPL with some special QPL exceptions for Qt.

Several GUI plugins for console, Qt etc. are available as separate
packages.
