From the BSFlite homepage:
BSFlite is a rather small and "minimalistic" client for AOL(R)'s Instant
Messenger(TM) service. Instead of having a full screen console interface,
BSFlite employs a command shell interface that allows your fingers to
do all of the work without needlessly sifting through windows.
