The Invisible IRC Project (IIP) was originally created so that people
interested in facilitating privacy and free speech could work to
these ends in an equally secure and anonymous environment. It has now
become a haven for anyone seeking anonymous, encrypted Internet Relay
Chat. The project's inspiration arose primarily from a shared
interest in the Freenet Project and a desire to provide the real-time
communications capabilities that Freenet could not.
