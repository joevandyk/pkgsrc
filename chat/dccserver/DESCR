dccserver is a standalone program aiming to provide the functions
of mIRC's /dccserver command.

Currently, Chat and Send (including resume) modes are supported.
Fserve and Get mode are not yet supported.

All connections are accepted; some simple checks on allowed file
names are done.  For more details, please look in the man pages.
