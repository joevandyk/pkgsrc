bitlbee is an IRC gateway to other chat networks.  It provides an IRC server
where users connect to and have access to all their contacts in ICQ, MSN,
Jabber or even IRC itself.  Protocols are implemented using Gaim's code.
Multiple users are supported too, where each one has its own set of accounts
and contacts.
