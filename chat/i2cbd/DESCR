                  I2CB icbd -- the Improved ICB Server
                  ------------------------------------
ICBD is an online chat system which allows a large number of users
to participate in realtime online discussions.  Among the features
of the ICB chat system are:

  * Simple, fast protocol and efficient polling-based implementation
    minimize `lag' effects

  * Persistent user database allows authentication of nicknames,
    storage of various user information, and leaving messages for
    users who are not logged on at the moment.

  * Any user may create groups, and exercise control over those
    groups, allowing for a wide range of discussion styles.  This
    control includes making groups public or private, visible or
    invisible, and moderated or unmoderated

  * The fabulous, famous '/brick' command lends true interactivity
    to the chat experience :-)
