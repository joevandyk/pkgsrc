Alvaro's Messenger, or Another MSN messenger clone is a modified and
multilanguage version of Compu's Messenger (CCMSN). It's a Tcl/Tk script
as was CCMSN and Tcl/Tk must be installed to run it. This means it is
multiplatform and can run on any OS having Tcl/Tk installed (Linux, Windows,
Macintosh).

It's a clone of the original MSN Messenger, having the same look and feel.
Some of it features are:

* Sound for Events
* Look and Feel similar to original MSN Messenger
* Multilanguage (Around 40 languages currently supported)
* Running multiple instances of AMSN at once for multiple logins
* File Transfers
* Group Support
* Normal and Animated Emoticons with sounds
* Chat History
