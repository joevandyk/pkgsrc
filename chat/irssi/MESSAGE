This version of irssi has support for character set conversions. Irssi is
able to transliterate unavailable characters if transliteration is
supported by GLib.
This is currently only supported on systems which use the gnu iconv for
glib2. Enabling it on systems without the gnu iconv will case the following
warning: Transliterations not supported in this system
