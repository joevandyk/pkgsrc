This is AOL's (R) ubiquitious Instant Messenger (SM), a chat-type
client that enables you to converse with any AOL or AIM user. You'll
need a web browser to complete the free registration, or you can
use your existing screen name from AOL, Netscape, CompuServe 2000,
AOL Hometown, or AOL.com's Personal Finance Center.
