The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the Lotus Sametime
Community Client protocol.

The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing the
basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core services;
Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user Conferencing, Preferences
Storage, Identity Resolution, and File Transfer. This extensible client
interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime,
allowing for simple integration of future service handlers such as the
user directory and whiteboard and screen-sharing.

The library can be used by IM clients such as pidgin to chat with
Sametime users.
