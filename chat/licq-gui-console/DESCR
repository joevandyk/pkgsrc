Licq Console Plugin

This is a console ui plugin for the Licq ICQ client.  It is considered beta
at this point and does not have all the features that the qt-gui supports,
however does offer a number of really cool text-mode things.  Multiple windows,
contact list pane, log window...

Running is simply a matter of running licq with the "-p console" switch.
Remember that Licq will save the plugin being run so after running
"licq -p console" once, it will always run with this plugin.  Hence when
you want to go back to the gui, use "licq -p qt-gui" the first time at least.
