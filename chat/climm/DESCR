climm is a very portable text-mode ICQ clone (formerly known as micq).

Originally written by Matthew D. Smith, a great part of climm
has been rewritten by Ruediger Kuhlmann, in particular the support
for the new version 8 of the OSCAR protocol that became necessary,
the internationalization, the file transfer and some restructuring
of the code.
