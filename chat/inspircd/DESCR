InspIRCd is a modular C++ IRC Daemon for Linux, BSD and Windows systems
created to provide a stable, modern, lightweight ircd (irc server) from
scratch and provide a vast number of features in a modularised form using
an advanced module API. By keeping the functionality of the main core to a
minimum we hope to increase the stability and speed of our project and make
it customisable to the needs of many users.
