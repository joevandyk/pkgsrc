Licensing GateD 


GateD has code in two source trees: 

     Public code (version 3), and 
     Consortium Code (versions 4, 5, and 6) 

The Consortium code is released in 3 separate versions: 

   1.Version 4 - GateD Unicast 
   2.Version 5 - GateD Multicast 
   3.Version 6 - GateD IPv6 

The Consortium code is developed out of a single library for
releases 4, 5, and 6. These releases have the nice features of
being "autoconfed" and will adapt more easily to your environment that the
public GateD code. You can probably obtain a "no-cost" license to use 
this code.  Please see ./doc/main.html for details.

Public code is available for anonymous ftp.  Any redistribution
of GateD public source code requires a Gated Redistribution License
for Version 3.  For a copy of the version 3 redistribution license
see ./doc/main.html for details or file
 ./doc/member_info/licenses/merit_license.v_3.0.
 
Consortium GateD (new) source code, tools and documentation is 
to GateD members only .  Binaries for utilities or on-line
documentation is available for anonymous ftp or via the web. 
Members of the Academic and Research community can join the the
Merit GateD Consortium at no cost by simply filling out a
GateD Academic and Research membership License. 

We have a very broad definition of what "Academic and Research" usage is. 

If you are at an Internet Service Provider, and want to use
GateD to debug problems, we still consider this an Academic and 
Research use.

If you want to use GateD at home, we encourage you to apply for the
Academic and Research license. The purpose behind the license is to
help us find out who uses the software and how. In addition, with proven
public use, we may be able to obtain more public money. The benefit of
public money is that more of GateD can be returned to the "public"
version of GateD. The Merit's GateD Consortium's goal is to keep
the quality of Software high in the Internet at large via 
technology transfer to both the Academic and Research in the Internet
at large and Commercial companies. 

We are working toward supporting all publically available operating 
systems as well as those of our members. The Merit GateD Consortium 
has not accomplished this goal, and looks to the linux,
FreeBSD, NETBSD, and other operating system communities for help. can use 

This membership simply requires that the member: 

     sign the GateD Membership, 
     register the machines to GateD source code and/or 
        binaries will be distributed, and 
     and agree to return any enhancements to the project for redistribution. 

The term of each of the Merit GateD Consortiuim licenses is 1 year. 
However, you may renew for 10 years or more. 

A Gold membership spans two product lines and allows for
commercial redistribution for both product lines. The other
membership categories are in respect to a particular product line.
Membership is a requirement for distribution of GateD sources or binaries. 

For commerical redistrbution you need to become either a 

     Gold member, or a 
     Commercial member , or 
     Small Commerical member. 

For redistribution to support a Commerical Internet Service, you need to become either a 

     Service member or a 
     Small Service . 

Each of the commerical memberships require a fee. 

For redistribution of binaries and sources within the Academic and Research community, you may
become either an: 

     Academic and Research member, or a 
     Supporting Academic member.

All licenses are on ./doc/member_info/licenses.
