without limitation, in testing Covered Code pursuant to Section III.A. Any
changes to the Compliance Materials which you propose to Original Contributor
shall be subject to the license grant set forth in Section III.B.

6. Requirements for Determining Compliance.

a) Development Restrictions. A Compliant Implementation:

i. must fully comply with the Technology Specifications for the Technology to
which this Technology Specific Attachment applies; and

ii. must not modify or extend the required public class or public interface
declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", "jini", "net.jini",
"sun.hotjava", "COM.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent class,
interface and/or package naming convention adopted by Original Contributor. It
is specifically suggested that You name any new Java packages using the
"Unique Package Naming Convention" as described in "The Java Language
Specification" by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1,
August 1996. Section 7.7 "Unique Package Names", on pages 125 and 126 of this
specification says in part:

You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an
organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as "sun.com". You then
reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this example,
"com.sun" and use this as a prefix for your package names, using a convention
developed within your organization to further administer package names.

b) Covered Code. All Covered Code must constitute a Compliant Implementation
prior to any Commercial Use (other than pre-deployment testing), whether
originating with You or acquired through a third party. Successful
compatibility testing must be completed by You, or by a third party authorized
by Original Contributor to conduct such tests, using the most current version
of the applicable Compliance Materials available no less than one hundred and
twenty (120) days prior to Your Commercial Use. If You make any further
Modifications to any Covered Code previously determined to be a Compliant
Implementation, You must retest the new Covered Code to ensure that it
continues to be a Compliant Implementation. For this retest, You may use the
same version of the Compliance Materials as used originally or, at your
option, You may use a more current version of the Compliance Materials.

c) Test Results. Upon Original Contributor's written request, You agree to
provide to Original Contributor or the third party test facility, if
applicable, Your test results that demonstrate that Covered Code is a
Compliant Implementation, and that Original Contributor may publish or
otherwise distribute such test results.

Agreed:
You Original Contributor
