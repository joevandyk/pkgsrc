THE C-KERMIT 7.0 LICENSE

  Last update: Sat Jan  1 10:47:35 2000

This is the new C-Kermit 7.0 license.  The intention is to allow C-Kermit to
be distributed with "free" operating systems such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, The Hurd, etc, even when the distributions themselves (such
as Red Hat or Caldera) might be sold and/or might include applications that
are not free, and yet still require a license to include C-Kermit in or with
"non-free" products such as commercial OS's, commercial software packages,
embedded systems, and hardware (other than general-purpose computers
preloaded with "free" operating systems), since these licenses furnish a
large portion of the Kermit Project's funding.

  All rights reserved.

PERMISSIONS:

The C-Kermit software may be obtained directly from the Kermit Project at
Columbia University (or from any source explicitly licensed by the Kermit
Project or implicitly licensed by Clause (A) below) by any individual for
his or her OWN USE, and by any company or other organization for its own
INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION and use, including installation on servers that are
accessed by customers or clients, WITHOUT EXPLICIT LICENSE.

Conditions for REDISTRIBUTION are as follows:

(A) The C-Kermit software, in source and/or binary form, may be
    included WITHOUT EXPLICIT LICENSE in distributions of OPERATING
    SYSTEMS that have OSI (Open Source Initiative, www.opensource.org)
    approved licenses, even if non-Open-Source applications (but not
    operating systems) are included in the same distribution.  Such
    distributions include, but are not limited to, CD-ROM, FTP site,
    Web site, or preinstalled software on a new GENERAL-PURPOSE
    computer, as long as the primary character of the distribution is
    an Open Source operating system with accompanying utilities.  The
    C-Kermit source code may not be changed without the consent of the
    Kermit Project, which will not be unreasonably withheld (this is
    simply a matter of keeping a consistent and supportable code base).

(B) Inclusion of C-Kermit software in whole or in part, in any form, in
    or with any product not covered by Clause (A), or its distribution
    by any commercial enterprise to its actual or potential customers
    or clients except as in Clause (A), requires a license from the
    Kermit Project, Columbia University; contact kermit@columbia.edu.

The name of Columbia University may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from or including the C-Kermit software without specific
prior written permission.
