CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR TERMS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WHETHER
BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS,
MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Pre-release Product Additional Terms. If the product you have
received with this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software
("Pre-release Software"), then the following Section applies. To
the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with
any other term or condition in this Agreement, this Section shall
supercede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the
Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve
the conflict. You acknowledge that the Software is a pre-release
version, does not represent final product from Adobe, and may
contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or
other failures and data loss. Consequently, the Pre-release Software
is provided to you "AS-IS", and Adobe disclaims any warranty or
liability obligations to you of any kind. WHERE LEGALLY LIABILITY
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED,
ADOBE'S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO
THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50) IN TOTAL.  You acknowledge that
Adobe has not promised or guaranteed to you that Pre-release Software
will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, that
Adobe has no express or implied obligation to you to announce or
introduce the Pre-release Software and that Adobe may not introduce
a product similar to or compatible with the Pre-release Software.
Accordingly, you acknowledge that any research or development that
you perform regarding the Pre-release Software or any product
associated with the Pre-release Software is done entirely at your
own risk. During the term of this Agreement, if requested by Adobe,
you will provide feedback to Adobe regarding testing and use of
the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports. If you
have been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate
written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated Serial
Agreement for Unreleased Products, your use of the Software is also
governed by such agreement. You agree that you may not and certify
that you will not sublicense, lease, loan, rent, or transfer the
Pre-release Software. Upon receipt of a later unreleased version
of the Pre-release Software or release by Adobe of a publicly
released commercial version of the Software, whether as a stand-alone
product or as part of a larger product, you agree to return or
destroy all earlier Pre-release Software received from Adobe and
to abide by the terms of the End User License Agreement for any
such later versions of the Pre-release Software.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Section to the contrary, if you are located outside
the United States of America, you agree that you will return or
destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software within
thirty (30) days of the completion of your testing of the Software
when such date is earlier than the date for Adobe's first commercial
shipment of the publicly released (commercial) Software.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS
OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR
ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS
APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION.
ADOBE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID
FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits

resulting from Adobe's negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud).
