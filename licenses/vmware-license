ferred  to  herein  as the "Software Product." A software license
and a license key or serial number ("Software Product  License"),
issued  to  a  designated  user  only by VMware or its authorized
agents, is required for each user of the Software Product. If you
do  not  agree  to the terms of this EULA, then do not install or
use the Software Product or the Software Product License. By  ex-
plicitly accepting this EULA, however, or by installing, copying,
downloading, accessing, or otherwise using the  Software  Product
and/or Software Product License, you are acknowledging and agree-
ing to be bound by the following terms:

1. WARNING -- (for  Evaluation  Licenses  only).   This  Software
Product  can  be used in conjunction with a free evaluation Soft-
ware Product License. If you are using such an  evaluation  Soft-
ware  Product  License,  you may use the Software Product only to
evaluate its suitability for purchase. Evaluation Software  Prod-
uct  Licenses  have an expiration date. VMWARE BEARS NO LIABILITY
FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM USE (OR ATTEMPTED  USE  AFTER  THE
EXPIRATION DATE) OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND HAS NO DUTY TO PRO-
VIDE ANY SUPPORT.

2. GRANT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE.

which is issued to a designated user, enables such designated us-
er to use the Software Product on a single computer system.  Each
user  on a multi-user computer system who uses the Software Prod-
uct requires an additional Software Product License.  You may not
modify  or  create  derivative copies of the Software Product Li-
cense.

.    Grant of License.  Subject  to  a  validly  issued  Software
Product  License,  VMware  grants  to you the non-exclusive, non-
transferable right for you to use the Software Product on a  sin-
gle  computer  running  a  validly licensed copy of the operating
system for which the Software Product was designed.  You may  not

vided that any such user agree to and abide by the terms of  this
EULA;  provided  further that you must acquire and dedicate a li-
cense for each separate computer system  on  which  the  Software
Product is installed.  Under this shared computing laboratory use
license, a computing laboratory at an academic institution having
ten  computers  loaded with the Software Product on which no more
than five users would concurrently access and  use  the  Software
Product,  for example, would require ten Software Product Licens-
es.  Unless the computing laboratory is operated  and  maintained
by and within an academic institution, professional certification
and training center, or quality  assurance  group,  this  limited
shared use license does not apply.  No other shared or concurrent
use of the Software Product  is  permitted.  You  may  not  rent,
lease, sublicense, or lend the Software Product.

ware Product as  reasonably  necessary  for  the  use  authorized
above,  including  as needed for backup and/or archival purposes.

right  and other proprietary rights notices on or in the Software
Product.  .    Backup Copy: Software Product  License.   You  may
install each Software Product License on a single computer system

for  backup  and/or  archival  purposes.   No other copies may be
made.  Each copy must reproduce all copyright and  other  propri-
etary rights notices on or in the Software Product License.

ing this EULA, or by installing, copying, downloading, accessing,

terms of EULA for the pre-installed Guest Operating System, which
