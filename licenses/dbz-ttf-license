                    [ Divide By Zero ] Fonts
                     http://fonts.tom7.com/

I am employing a very generous license with these fonts (the way I
think most software should be) for a number of reasons. Mainly though,
it is because I would be making fonts regardless of whether I was
distributing them or not, and because I know that people benefit from
the fact that I give them away. I take enough stuff for free and it
makes me feel good to know that I am 'giving back'.

Here is the license. You are free to download and use these fonts
without my explicit permission for anything you want, except for the
following:

     You may NOT* resell the actual font files (without my written
     permission and without having to give me something in
     return). This includes but is not limited to selling it on a Font
     CD (even when the fee involved is a nominal "distribution" or
     "handling" fee, or some similar thing), or distributing it on a
     site which charges a fee per font download. (In contrast, a
     pay-per-hour service such as America Online is free to distribute
     the fonts.)  You may not misrepresent the creator of the font
     (pretend you made them) You may not adapt them to different fonts
     without my permission.  You may not modify the font files for
     subsequent redistribution.

However, you have permission to do the following: 
  Use them to make graphics for your home page, non-profit web page,
    or commerical web site.
  Give them to your friends for free. 
  Make them available (for free) on your web page, as long as you make
    clear where they came from.
  Use them in design work that you get paid for. 
  Use them in any smalltime publications or fliers or other non
    mass-produced literature.
  Make commercial products like T-shirts or Mugs or Books using the
    fonts and sell them. In this case, since you are indirectly
    profiting off of my work, I ask that you send me one of the T-shirts
    or Mugs or Books free, where reasonable. Obviously some discretion
    on your part is due; but try to be fair. If it is inappropriate for
    you to send me one of your product, at least make an attempt to
    write me an e-mail at imightbetm@aol.com and let me know where the
    font is being used.

* "Not", as in, "Not without my permission". I regularly give
  permission for this sort of thing, so if you want to redistribute
  the fonts for a fee, let me know and we can probably work something
  out. Generally I simply request a copy of the CD or magazine or
  whatever.

Exception to the above: The fonts (or converted versions of the fonts)
may be included on any recognized distribution of the Linux operating
system, even if the CD is sold. Please include this README file.
In addition, explicit permission is given for simtel.net, cdrom.com
and their partners to distribute this collection on physical medium.
