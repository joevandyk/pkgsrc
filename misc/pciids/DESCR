This package contains a public list of all known IDs used in PCI devices;
that is ID's of vendors, devices, subsystems and device classes.  These ID
lists (usually in form of a pci.ids file) are used in various programs (The
Linux Kernel, The PCI Utilities, new version of the XFree86 etc.) to display
full device names instead of the numeric IDs.
