Reed is a program originally written to automatically scroll large
text files, such as etexts from Project Gutenberg (http://promo.net/pg
or http://www.gutenberg.net), but its functionality has quickly
expanded to make it a decent regular text pager, as well. Anyone
familiar with CSpotRun for the Palm PDA or the DOS pager Smooth will
have little trouble with Reed's interface.
