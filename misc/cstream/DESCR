   cstream is a general-purpose stream-handling tool like UNIX' dd,
   usually used in commandline-constructed pipes.

   Featues:
     Sane commandline switch syntax.
     Exact throughput limiting, on the incoming side. Timing variance in
       previous reads are counterbalanced in the following reads.
     Precise throughput reporting. Either at the end of the transmission
       or everytime SIGUSR1 is received. Quite useful to ask lengthy
       opertions how much data has been transferred yet, i.e. when
       writing tapes. Reports are done in bytes/sec and if appropriate in
       KB/sec or MB/sec, where 1K = 1024.
     SIGUSR2 causes a clean shutdown before EOF on input, timing
       informating is displayed.
     Build-in support for fifos. Example usage is a 'pseudo-device',
       something that sinks or delivers data at an appropriate rate, but
       looks like a file, i.e. if you test soundcard software. See the
       manpage for examples.
     Accepts 'k', 'm' and 'g' character after number for "kilo, mega,
       giga" bytes for overall data size limit.
