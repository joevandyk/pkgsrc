There exist a few filters that help tapes streams by buffering IO and
allowing reads to overlaps with writes under Unix. Most of these filters
rely on relatively unportable features, for example SYSV like shared
memory.

team is a filter that runs essentially unchanged on any Unix version, as
it relies only on features present in V7. A number of team processes
(team members) share a common input fd and a common output fd, and they
take turns at reading from the former and writing to the latter; they
synchronize by using a ring of pipes between them, where a "read-enable"
and a "write-enable" token circulate.

The team source is GPL'ed, and it comes with no warranty.
