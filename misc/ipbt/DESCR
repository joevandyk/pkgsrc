IPBT plays ttyrec files, like ttyplay, but provides the ability to
seek forward and backward in the recorded file.  Additional features
include slow motion and fast forwarding.

The ttydump and ttygrep utilities provide functionality to extract
part of the recorded file and to search for frames containing a
search pattern, respectively.
