Qterm is a program that queries terminals to find out what kind of
terminal is responding.  It is useful to automagically define your
terminal type.  It prints the name of the terminal (compatible,
hopefully, with a termcap/terminfo name) such as "vt100" to standard
output.  See the manual for details.
