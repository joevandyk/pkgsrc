  Addresses for GNUstep is a versatile address book application for
managing contact information.  It stores addresses, phone numbers,
pictures, instant messaging information, email, homepages and whatever.

  Addresses is also a framework that allows access to the addresses
database in a way that is sourcecode-compatible with Apple's
AddressBook.framework.  It also contains a view framework to facilitate the
construction of applications that use the contact database.

  Addresses is currently being used by Ludovic Marcotte's GNUMail
application. It uses and requires GNUstep.
