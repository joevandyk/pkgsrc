autocue is a program which takes a simple text file as input, and
outputs its contents, broken up into paragraphs, and formatted by fmt,
into xcb's cut buffers.  From there, the text can be pasted with a
simple mouse click.  autocue will then wait for a period of time
relative to the size of the text, before moving onto the next
paragraph. Successive cut buffers will be used, and then will wrap
to the beginning.

The speed can be varied whilst the program is running - by sending
a SIGUSR1 to the process, autocue will go faster. Sending a SIGUSR2
to the process will make it go slower.

This program can be used to scroll a presentation, along with timing
information (a beep is sounded when the next buffer should be pasted),
and the presenter can simply paste into the presentation window.
