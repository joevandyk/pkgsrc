Flynn is a tiny system load meter for gkrellm. I've picked
this idea from Timm Mueller's Amiga application which was
derived from a WindowMaker appicon. GKrellFlynn was
written by Henryk Richter.

Flynn is a guy who suffers from your activity, i.e. the
applications consuming precious processor time. Hurt him
plenty!

To make Flynn smile, just click onto his face.
