Wiki is a concept, more than a thing.  It is a way of creating
document pages using plain text markup and simplified hyperlinking.
By typing a name in MixedCase, a hyperlink is automatically created to
the document "MixedCase".  Pressing return on that name will create
the file if it doesn't exist, or visit it if it does.  The markup used
by emacs-wiki is intended to be very friendly to people familiar with
Emacs.  Type C-h v emacs-wiki-publishing-markup after this mode is
loaded for how to get started.
