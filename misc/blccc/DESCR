This is a rewrite of the master control program for Blinkenlights.
The first implementation used to be a GTK+ application that allowed
previewing of movies and run-time modification of the playlist using
a graphical user interface.  The need for a way to control
the Blinkenlights remotely arose, so this new implementation runs as
a daemon controllable via telnet connections.  This software was used
for the Blinkenlights installation at the end of September 2001.
