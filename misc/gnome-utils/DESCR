  This package contains a number of useful utilities/apps that run
under the GNOME2 desktop environment.

From the GNOME home page:

GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment.  The GNOME
project intends to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based
entirely on free software.  GNOME is part of the GNU project, and
GNOME is part of the OpenSource(tm) movement.  The desktop will
consist of small utilities and larger applications which share a
consistent look and feel.  GNOME uses GTK+ as the GUI toolkit for
all GNOME-compliant applications.
