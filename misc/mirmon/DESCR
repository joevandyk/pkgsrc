Many software projects are mirrored worldwide. The mirror sites are
required to update the mirror archive regularly (daily, weekly) from
a root server.

Mirmon helps administrators in keeping an eye on the mirror sites. In
a concise graphic format, mirmon shows each site's status history of
the last two weeks. It is easy to spot stale or dead mirrors.
