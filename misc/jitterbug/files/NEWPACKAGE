Adding a new Package (Category) to jitterbug

During the initial install, jitterbug already set up a package (category)
for you: package @JB_PACKAGE@.

The jitterbug package has been set up such that you can add additional
categories. In the following, replace NEWPACKAGE by the name of your
new category.

Here is a short overview about the required steps:

(As @JB_USER@ user:)
o Create a directory @PREFIX@/@JB_USER@/NEWPACKAGE/bug_tracking

o Copy the config files found under @PREFIX@/@JB_USER@/config to
  @PREFIX@/@JB_USER@/NEWPACKAGE/bug_tracking

o Customize these files

(As root:)
o Copy the jitterbug binary (@PREFIX@/@JB_USER@/bin/jitterbug) to apache's
  cgi-bin directory (@PREFIX@/libexec/cgi-bin); name it NEWPACKAGE

o Make a hard link in the same directory to NEWPACKAGE.private

o Set the right protections on these binaries:
  chown root.nobody NEWPACKAGE NEWPACKAGE.private
  chmod 4710 NEWPACKAGE NEWPACKAGE.private

o Go to @PREFIX@/etc/jitterbug and copy @JB_PACKAGE@ to NEWPACKAGE and
  customize NEWPACKAGE for your preferences

o Copy NEWPACKAGE to NEWPACKAGE.private or make a symbolic link

o Add an entry for NEWPACKAGE-bugs to the mail aliases (/etc/aliases)
  and run newaliases
  
o Add appropriate config lines for NEWPACKAGE (at the end) to
  @PREFIX@/etc/httpd/httpd.conf

o Have httpd rescan @PREFIX@/etc/httpd/httpd.conf by sending it SIGUSR1
