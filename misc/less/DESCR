Less is a pager program more advanced than more(1). Its features include
backward movement, searching and highlighting, multiple files, bold and
underlining, key bindings (using lesskey(1)), customized tab stops,
filters for different file types, custom character sets, line numbering,
custom prompts, and many more.

Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting,
so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
vi(1).

This package also includes the lessecho command which can expand
metacharacters, such as * and ?, in filenames.

This version of less was written by and is maintained by Mark Nudelman.
