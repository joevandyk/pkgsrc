MOLDEN is a package for displaying molecular density.  It is tuned to
the  Ab Initio packages GAMESS* and  GAUSSIAN.   It can read all  the
information it needs  from a GAMESS or GAUSSIAN outputfile.   In this
form it has been  running  on a  CONVEX C-120, an  APOLLO DN10000, an
IRIS 4D/70GT, a DECSTATION 5000 and a SUN, and  in  slightly  adapted
versions  on a VAX  and a CRAY-YMP.   It should  run smoothly on most
Unix machines.   See section  INSTALLATION GUIDE  on  how  to install
MOLDEN.  (* The  GAMESS  version  referred  to  here  is the european
version maintaned by M.F.   Guest  et  al not to be confused with the
american version maintained by M.W.  Schmidt et al)
