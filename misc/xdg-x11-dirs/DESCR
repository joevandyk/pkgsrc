xdg-x11-dirs installs a set of shared directories used by freedesktop.org
XDG based systems (kde 3.2 and gnome 2.4).  It is useful to simplify PLIST
handling in other packages.

This package differs from xdg-dirs in that shared directories are created
under X11's tree.  Has no effect if using xpkgwedge, other than depending
directly on xdg-dirs.
