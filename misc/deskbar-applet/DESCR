The goal of DeskbarApplet is to provide an omnipresent versatile search
interface.  By typing search terms into the deskbar entry in your panel
you are presented with the search results as you type.

Seaches are handled by a series of plugins.  DeskbarApplet provides a
simple interface to manage these plugins to provide you with the search
results that fit your needs.
