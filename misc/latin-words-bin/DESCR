This Latin dictionary program takes keyboard input or a file of
Latin text lines and provides an analysis/morphology (declension,
conjugation, case, tense, etc.) of each word individually, the
dictionary form, and the translation (meaning).

 am.at           V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
 amo, amare, amavi, amatus
 love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;

The dictionary contains over 30000 entries and, through additional
word construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes, may
generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words'
that can be formed by declension and conjugation.  Present emphasis
is on classical Latin and late Latin, but medieval Latin entries
are increasing. WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for
the Latin student and a memory jog for researchers.
