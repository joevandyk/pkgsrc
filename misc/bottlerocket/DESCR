What is BottleRocket?

  BottleRocket is a command-line interface for Unix systems to use the
  FireCracker kit. It is easy to use, has all of the major (non-gui)
  functionality of the Windows interface, is easy to call from scripts
  and the backend code is made to be easily linked into other programs.

What is the X10 FireCracker kit?

  The X10 Firecracker kit is a simple wireless home automation system,
  consisting of a lamp module, an appliance module/radio receiver, a
  hand held wireless transmitter and a wireless transmitter that plugs
  into a standard RS-232 serial port. Using either the handheld
  transmitter or the serial port transmitter, a user can turn on or off
  any of up to 256 appliances, and brighten/dim any of those that happen
  to be lamps and plugged into the special lamp modules. Each appliance
  to be controlled must be plugged into its own module, and each module
  is set (by turning dials on the front) to a unique address by which it
  is identified.
