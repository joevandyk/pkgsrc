Przemek's info viewer is a neat alternative to the gnu "info" program.
The lynx-like key bindings are run-time configurable, as is the linux
console-style color scheme. Embedded URIs become links that open into
"lynx", and email addresses into "pine" (if either or both are installed).
It can even give the same treatment to man pages!
