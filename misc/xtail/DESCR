"xtail" watches the growth of files.  It's like running a "tail -f"
on a bunch of files at once.  The syntax is:

	xtail name ...

You can specify both filenames and directories on the command line.
If you specify a directory, it watches all the files in that
directory.  It will notice when new files are created (and start
watching them) or when old files are deleted (and stop watching
them).
