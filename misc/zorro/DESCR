The program allows you to set up a tree of actions starting
from an (invisible) root and going down to as many levels as you
specify.  Associated with each action is a descriptive note, a done/
not done flag, an optional priority and an optional completion date
(more to come). Zorro stores your to-do list in the file ~/.zorrodb
and it reads the file ~/.zorrorc on startup. There are quite a lot of
configurable items - look at /usr/pkg/share/zorro/DOTzorrorc for
further details.
