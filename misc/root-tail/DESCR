Displays a given file anywhere on your X11 root window with a transparent
background.  It was made because I'm very lazy and this was easier than
making a new rxvt pixmap each time I changed my background to simulate that
transparent effect.  A null desc (example: "/var/log/messages,red,") will
prevent the printing of a description and the []'s.
