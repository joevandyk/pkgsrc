This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and
control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.

Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
disc images as though they were CDs.
