`FD' (FDclone) is a file and directory management tool for text
terminal; browsing file list, viewing, editing, archiving/extracting
management with a few touch.  FD 2.0 and later have a built-in
Bourne-shell compatible shell and also runs stand-alone shell under
the name of 'fdsh'.

This version is a clone of original FD for DOS (AT and PC9801)
designed and written by A. Idei (SDI00544@niftyserve.or.jp).

Currently, the man page is available only in Japanese, but it's easy
to use. Setting `FD_LANGUAGE' environment to 'english' you can use
English help.
