bbweather is a tool which displays the current weather conditions in an
decorated window, simulating the look of the Blackbox toolbar (Blackbox is a
Windowmanager for X11).  This tool is heavily based on "bbdate" by John
Kennis.  Furthermore, bbweather was inspired by wmWeather by Michael G.
Henderson, from where the perl-script to fetch the weather-conditions from
your local station originated.
