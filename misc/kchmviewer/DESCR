KchmViewer is a CHM (MS HTML help file format) viewer, written in
C++. Unlike most existing CHM viewers for Unix, it uses Trolltech
Qt widget library with optional KDE libraries. It does not require
KDE, but may be compiled with full KDE support, including KDE
widgets and KIO/KHTML.

The main advantage of KchmViewer is extra support for non-English
languages. Unlike other viewers, KchmViewer in most cases is able
to detect help file encoding, correctly shows tables of context of
Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese help files, and does correct
search in non-English help files (search for MBCS languages -
ja/ko/ch is still in progress).
