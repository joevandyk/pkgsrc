       Less  is  a  program similar to more (1), but which allows
       backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.
       Also,  less  does  not  have to read the entire input file
       before starting, so with large input files  it  starts  up
       faster  than  text editors like vi (1).

  This enhanced less support ISO 2022 code extension techniqes and
Japanese codes(EUC Japanese, SJIS) and compressed(or gzipped) file
viewing. The author of this patch is jam@pobox.com. See
