Splitvt splits the screen into two windows, each running a shell, so you
can do and see two things at once.

Using special keys, the focus may be changed from one window to another.
Other features include cut & pasting between windows, and the ability to
the terminal.

Note: users may want to take a look at /usr/bin/window (see ``man window'')
for a Free/NetBSD native version this type of program.
