The Uptime Project consists of three parts: The first is one tiny
client that runs on each host that takes part in the project and
sends information about its uptime to the project. The second part
is a central database-server that collects and stores updates from
all participating hosts, and the third part is a website where
statistics can be viewed and users can administrate their accounts
and add new hosts.
