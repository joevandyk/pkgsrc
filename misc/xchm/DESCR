xCHM is a CHM viewer for UNIX, based on Jed Wing's CHMLIB and
written with wxWindows. xCHM can view your files, show the contents
tree if one is available, print the current page, work with bookmarks
and do the usual history stunts. It allows you to change fonts and
search for text in all the pages of the archive, or in the pages'
titles. What it can't do is handle Javascript by the book.
