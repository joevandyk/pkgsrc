This is a simple hack to the FreeBSD /bin/ls to use ANSI sequences to
display file attributes in color.  There is a -G flag (somewhat
similar to the -F flag).  Take a look at the man page for details.

Standard xterm prior to XFree86 3.1.2B doesn't know about colors, so
you should use update your XFree86 or use kterm (available from the
packages collection).
