`xrolodex' is a Rolodex(R)-style application for maintaining a set of
"virtual business cards."  `xrolodex's top-level window includes four
principal components:
 - an application-level menu bar,
 - a label area for displaying the name of the current rolodex file,
 - a control panel for entry-level rolodex manipulation, and
 - an edit window (with local menu bar) for editing the currently
   displayed rolodex entry, also providing a basic viewport facility.
