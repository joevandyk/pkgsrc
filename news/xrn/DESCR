  XRN is a Usenet News reader for the X window system.  It requires an
NNTP server to talk to (i.e., it cannot read news from local disk
files), and the NNTP server must support the XHDR command (most
servers nowadays do; if yours doesn't, XRN will complain when you try
to run it).

  XRN is currently maintained by Jonathan Kamens.  Bug reports or
comments about it should be sent to bug-xrn@kamens.brookline.ma.us.
Please do *not* write to that address with basic questions about
compiling the program; if you are unfamiliar with compiling X
applications and the instructions below are not sufficient, you should
seek help at your site.

  Versions of XRN prior to 7.00 were maintained by Ellen Santovich and
Rick Spickelmier.
