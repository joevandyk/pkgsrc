The primary use for suck is to feed a local INN or CNEWS server, without
the remote NNTP feeding you articles.  It is designed for a small, partial
news feed.  It is NOT designed to feed 10,000 groups and 3 Gigs of articles
a day.

This package contains software for copying news from an NNTP server to your
local machine, and copying replies back up to an NNTP server.

The suck/rpost combination allows you to run your own INN/CNEWS site,
controlling where you get your news, and where you post outgoing articles.
Suck/rpost use only standard NNTP commands that are used by your favorite
news reader (tin, xvnews, strn) such as POST and ARTICLE.  If you can use tin
or xvnews against a NNTP site, than you can use Suck/Rpost.
