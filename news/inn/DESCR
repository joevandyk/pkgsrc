This is the public release of InterNet News (INN). This work is
sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.

InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the
package is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading
is handled by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each
client.  Both innd and nnrpd have some slight variances from the
NNTP protocol.

You can set the environment variable INN_SPOOL to whatever you like
to change the default spool directory when building this pkg.
