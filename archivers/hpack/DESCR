       The  hpack  Multi-System  Archiver is an archiver that was
       written to allow the transfer of archived data to  differ-
       ent  systems.   In  the	past archivers have traditionally
       been  available	for  single  systems  only,  for  example
       PKZIP  and  LHARC  for  the  IBM PC, Larc for the Amiga,
       StuffIt and Compactor for the  Macintosh,  and  tar  and
       compress  for  UNIX  systems  (while  these  archivers are
       available on other systems, their use is not  widespread).
       Open-keys security included.
