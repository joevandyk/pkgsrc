Star is a full-featured tar command that can access local and remote
tar archives (files and tapes). It reads and writes POSIX compliant
tar archives as well as non-POSIX GNU tar archives.
Star is the first POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar implementation. It includes
a FIFO for speed, a pattern matcher, multi-volume support, the ability to
archive sparse files and ACLs and the ability to archive extended file flags.
It supports utomatic archive format detection, automatic byte order
recognition, automatic archivecompression/decompression. It includes the
only known platform independent "rmt" server program that implements all
Sun/GNU/Schily/BSD enhancements and allows any "rmt" client from any OS to
contact any OS as server.
