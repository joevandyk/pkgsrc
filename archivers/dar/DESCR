DAR is a Disk ARchiver, for backing-up file systems to disk.  It's rather
in the spirit of TAR, with some additions.  Notably:

	DAR can break up a archive into multiple files, to facilitate
	storage on portable media, like CDs or DVDs.

	Can perform incremental back-ups against a reference archive, or,
	more conveniently, a "catalog" of an archive, which is sort of a
	combination of a TAR table-of-contents and a file checksum list.

DAR also supports filtering, so files or directories can be excluded from
an archive, compression, filtered compression, and the inclusion of parity
in archives, to help recover from media errors.
