Xbin converts a file created by BinHex (usually named with one of the
extensions ".hex", ".hcx", or ".hqx") into three host-system files
suitable for downloading to a Macintosh via macput.

  This program was designed for use with the 1.1 Release version of
MacTerminal, but includes a compatibility option for the old -0.15X
Almost-Alpha version.
