Bicom is a data compressor in the PPM family. It is freely available and
open source.  Compression with bicom is completely bijective -- any file
is a possible bicom output that can be decompressed, and then
recompressed back to its original form.  Of course, any file is also a
possible bicom input that can be compressed, and then decompressed back
to its original form.
