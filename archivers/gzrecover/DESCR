So you thought you had your files backed up onto that jaz cartridge -
until it came time to restore. Then you found out that you had bad
sectors and you've lost almost everything because gzip craps out 10%
of the way through your archive. The gzip Recovery Toolkit has a program
- gzrecover - that attempts to skip over bad data in a gzip archive and
to GNU tar that enables that program to skip over bad data and extract
whatever files might be there.
