LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI
C.  It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.  In addition, there are slower
compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio
while still decompressing at this very high speed.

This package contains the older v1 release of the library.
See pkgsrc/archivers/lzo for the current version.
