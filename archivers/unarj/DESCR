This is an extract only program which allows access to the contents of ARJ
archives.

     COMMAND SYNTAX:

     UNARJ has been modified to support the four commands: "e", "l", "t",
     and "x".  These are similar to the ARJ version of these commands.
     However, UNARJ does not create directories when using the "x" command.

     Usage:  UNARJ archive[.arj]    (list archive)
             UNARJ e archive        (extract archive)
             UNARJ l archive        (list archive)
             UNARJ t archive        (test archive)
             UNARJ x archive        (extract with pathnames)

     UNARJ does not accept any other commands or options.  You cannot
     specify a base directory or select individual files to extract.  UNARJ
     does not support empty directories or volume labels.  UNARJ is much
     slower than ARJ because ARJ is highly optimized using assembly
     language.
