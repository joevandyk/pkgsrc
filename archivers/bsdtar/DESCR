The libarchive library contains routines for creating, reading from, and
writing to different streaming archive formats, e.g. most popular tar 
and cpio formats. Additionally, libarchive supports writing to shar archives 
and reading from ISO-9660 (CD-ROM) images.

This package contains bsdtar, a high-efficiency libarchive front-end which 
is [almost] wholly compatible with the ubiquitous GNU tar.  It supports 
advanced features many other implementations do not.

For your convenience, the installed bsdtar binary will not be linked 
to any pkgsrc-provided libraries.
