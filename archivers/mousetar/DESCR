I've written a tar that owes nothing to anything else.  It's in the
public domain and hence is free for NetBSD to steal, anything from
lifting it verbatim to swiping ideas from.

It doesn't currently have anything like --fast-read; that hadn't
occurred to me.  Now that it's been pointed out, I'll be adding it; I
think it's a valuable addition, whether or not NetBSD wants my tar.
