lbrate extracts/decompresses files from the CP/M LBR format. (It can also list
and test such archives.) It does this in an `unzip'-like manner, mostly hiding
the details of individually compressed and renamed files, and transparently
dealing with the required decompression/renaming.

lbrate is apparently the only non-CP/M program to fully support
decompressing files from all three CP/M compression schemes (Q, Z, Y). With
this in mind, it can decompress such files directly, treating them as if they
were single-entry LBRs.
