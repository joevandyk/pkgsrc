The Palm database archiver (pdbar) creates and manipulates PalmOS
database (.pdb) and resource (.prc) files.  Pdbar is designed to be a
Swiss army knife for managing these files.  It's a command line tool,
and not for the faint of heart, but it's very handy and replaces a
bunch of little utilities that you might otherwise use.
