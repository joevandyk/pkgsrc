cabextract is a program that un-archives files in the Microsoft
cabinet file format (.cab) or any binary file which contains an
embedded cabinet file (frequently found in .exe files).

cabextract will extract all files from all cabinet files specified on
the command line

To extract a multi-part cabinet consisting of several files, only give
the first file as an argument to cabextract as it will automatically
look for the remaining files.
