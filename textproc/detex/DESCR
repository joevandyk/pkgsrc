Detex - Version 2.7

Detex is a program to remove TeX constructs from a text file.  It recognizes
the \input command.

This program assumes it is dealing with LaTeX input if it sees the string
"\begin{document}" in the text.  It recognizes the \include and \includeonly
commands.

Feel free to redistribute this program, but distribute the complete contents
of this directory.  The latest version is available at

to me via email.
