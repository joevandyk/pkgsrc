catdoc behaves much like cat(1) but reads MS-Word file and produces
human-readable text on standard output.  Optionally it can use
latex(1) escape sequences for characters which have special meaning
for LaTeX.  It also makes some effort to recognize MS-Word tables,
although it never tries to write correct headers for LaTeX tabular
environment.

This package also includes catppt and xls2csv.  The catppt utility
reads MS-PowerPoint presentations and outputs its content to stdout.
The xls2csv utility reads MS-Excel spreadsheets and outputs its
content as comma-separated values to stdout. Numbers are printed
without delimiters and strings are enclosed in the double quotes.
Double-quotes inside string are doubled.
