Writer2LaTeX is a utility written in java. It converts OpenOffice.org/
StarOffice 6/7 Writer documents -- in particular documents containing
formulas -- into other formats.  It is actually a collection of four
converters:

 - Writer2LaTeX converts documents into LaTeX 2e format for high
   quality typesetting

 - Writer2BibTeX extracts bibliographic data from a document and
   stores it in BibTeX format (works together with Writer2LaTeX).

 - Writer2xhtml converts documents into XHTML 1.0 or
   XHTML 1.1+MathML 2.0 with CSS2.  This provides standards-compliant
   XHTML and brings your math to the web.

 - Calc2xhtml is a companion to Writer2xhtml that converts OOo Calc
   documents to XHTML 1.0 with CSS2 to display your spreadsheets on
   the web.
