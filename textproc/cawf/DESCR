Cawf is a C version of awf, Henry Spencer's Amazingly Workable (text)
Formatter.  (Awf is written in awk and appears in comp.sources.unix,
Volume 23, Issue 27.)  Cawf and awf provide a usable subset of raw nroff
capabilities and the styles of the man(7), me(7) (only cawf supports
me(7)), and ms(7) macro sets.

Like awf, cawf is completely independent of any licensed Unix source
code.  In comparison to awf, cawf supports more nroff functions and one
more macro set, me(7).
