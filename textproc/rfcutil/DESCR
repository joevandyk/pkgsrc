RFC Util allows you to specify the number of an RFC, or a search string, and
it returns all related RFCs. It features command line switches to spawn lynx
or w3m to view the RFC, dump to file for offline viewing, or mail to
an address. It also allows local and remote lookups of port, service,
or proto numbers.
