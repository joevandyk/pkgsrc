  Regexx is a complete regular expressions C++ solution.  It implements
easy expression execution, global searching, replace with atom
substitution, customized replaces, easy match and atom strings retrieving.
Also included in the library are functions to split strings using strings
or regular expressions.

  Since 0.97, Regexx is using Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.  It
means that you can use regular expressions very similar to the ones you
use with Perl.

  It's very easy to use Regexx.  Just include the "regexx" namespace and
the "regexx.hh" header in your project, create a Regexx instance and use
its methods as you like.
