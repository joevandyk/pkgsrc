The po4a (po for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and
more interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext
tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

In po4a each documentation format is handled by a module. For now,
there exist modules for the pod format (in which the perl documentation
is written), the good old man pages, and the documentation of the
kernel compilation options.  Some other modules are underway, like
for sgml, xml, or texinfo.
