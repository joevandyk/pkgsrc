If you are only interested in processing certain nodes in an XML
file, this module can help you simplify your Perl scripts significantly.

The XML::Node module allows you to register callback functions
or variables for any XML node. If you register a call back function,
it will be called when the node of the type you specified are
encountered. If you register a variable, the content of a XML node
will be appended to that variable automatically.
