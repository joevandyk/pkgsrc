Bibindex and biblook are programs for fast lookup in BibTeX
bibliography data bases.

Bibindex converts a .bib file to a .bix file, which is a compact
binary representation of the .bib file containing hash tables for fast
lookup, as well as byte offset positions into the corresponding .bib
file.

Biblook provides an interactive lookup facility using the .bix and
.bib files.
