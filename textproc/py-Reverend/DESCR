Reverend is a general purpose Bayesian classifier, named after
Rev. Thomas Bayes.  Use the Reverend to quickly add Bayesian smarts to
your app.  To use it in your own application, you either subclass
Bayes or pass it a tokenizing function. Bayesian fun has never been so
quick and easy.

Stuff you can do with the Reverend:
- classify RSS stories
- classify recipes by cuisine
- who do you write like? Shakespeare, Dickens or Austen
- detect the language of a document
- is your code more like Guido's or Peter's
