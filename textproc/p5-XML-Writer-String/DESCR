This module implements a bare-bones class specifically for
the purpose of capturing data from the XML::Writer module.
XML::Writer expects an IO::Handle object and writes XML
data to the specified object (or STDOUT) via its print()
method.  This module simulates such an object for the spe-
cific purpose of providing the required print() method.
