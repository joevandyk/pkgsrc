The aim of SCEW (by Aleix Conchillo Flaque) is to provide an easy
interface around the XML Expat parser.  Expat gives an API based on
event handling mechanisms to load XML files.  SCEW incorporates
functions to create XML files and handle XML trees.  That is, add and
delete nodes, change attribute names and values etc.

SCEW provides functions to load and access XML elements without the
need to create the event handling routines and probably the most
important: without the need to rewrite these functions each time you
need to load a different XML document.  It also lets you access the
internal Expat parser; that means you can still have all the
functionality that the Expat library gives you.
