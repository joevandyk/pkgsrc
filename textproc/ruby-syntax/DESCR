Syntax is a lexical analysis framework.  It supports pluggable syntax
modules, and comes with modules for Ruby, XML, and YAML.  It means you
can use Syntax to take a body of text representing instructions in
some syntax (like Ruby), and break that text into tokens.  You could
conceivably use it to count the number of classes in a system, or the
number of lines of code per method.  But Syntax was written
specifically with syntax highlighting in mind.
