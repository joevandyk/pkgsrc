XML::RSS::Parser is a lightweight liberal parser of RSS feeds that
is derived from the XML::Parser::LP module the I developed for
mt-rssfeed -- a Movable Type plugin. This parser is "liberal" in
that it does not demand compliance of a specific RSS version and
will attempt to gracefully handle tags it does not expect or
understand. The parser's only requirements is that the file is
well-formed XML and remotely resembles RSS.
