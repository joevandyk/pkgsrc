GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to eventually
replace Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell
checker. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up with
possible suggestions than just about any other spell checker out there for the
English language, including Ispell and Microsoft Word. It also has many other
technical enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries
and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell
process is open at once.
