cmTemplate is a Python module that allows CGI programmers to separate code
from HTML.  It is much more powerful than a simple HTML preprocessor, and
can be used to generate any type of formatted text output.

cmTemplate converts the template code into Python code, which is
byte-compiled afterwards.  This makes the template processing extremely
fast.
