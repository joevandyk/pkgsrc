A vCard is an electronic business card.

This package is for a single vCard (person / record / set of address
information). It provides an API to editing and creating vCards,
or supplied a specific piece of the Text::vFile::asData results it
generates a vCard with that content.

You should really use Text::vCard::Addressbook as this handles
creating vCards from an existing file for you.
