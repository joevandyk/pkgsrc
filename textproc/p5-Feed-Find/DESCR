The Perl module Feed::Find implements feed auto-discovery for finding
syndication feeds, given a URI. It (currently) passes all of the
auto-discovery tests at http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/autodiscovery/.
Feed::Find will discover the following feed formats:
* RSS 0.91
* RSS 1.0
* RSS 2.0
* Atom
