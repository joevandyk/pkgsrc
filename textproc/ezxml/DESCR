ezXML is a C library for parsing XML documents inspired by simpleXML
for PHP.  As the name implies, it's easy to use.  It's ideal for
parsing XML configuration files or REST web service responses.  It's
also fast and lightweight (less than 20k compiled).

An example of how to use the ezXML library can be found in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/ezxml
