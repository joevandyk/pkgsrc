PSGML is an emacs major mode for SGML documents.

PSGML has several functions for editing SGML documents. Indentation
according to element nesting depth and identification of structural
errors (but it is not a validating SGML parser). Menus and commands
for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags. Attribute
values can be edited in a separate window with information about
types and defaults. Structure based editing includes movement and
killing; and also several commands for folding editing.
