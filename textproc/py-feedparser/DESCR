Universal Feed Parser is a Python module for downloading and parsing
syndicated feeds. It can handle RSS 0.90, Netscape RSS 0.91, Userland
RSS 0.91, RSS 0.92, RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom 0.3,
Atom 1.0, and CDF feeds. It also parses several popular extension
modules, including Dublin Core and Apple's iTunes extensions.

To use Universal Feed Parser, you will need Python 2.1 or later.
Universal Feed Parser is not meant to run standalone; it is a module
for you to use as part of a larger Python program.

Universal Feed Parser is easy to use; the module is self-contained
in a single file, feedparser.py, and it has one primary public
function, parse. parse takes a number of arguments, but only one
is required, and it can be a URL, a local filename, or a raw string
containing feed data in any format.
