This module, which is built as a subclass of XML::Parser, provides a parser
for encoding map files, which are XML files. The file maps/encmap.dtd in the
distribution describes the structure of these files. Calling a parse method
returns the name of the encoding map (obtained from the name attribute of the
root element). The contents of the map are processed through the callback
functions push_prefix, pop_prefix, and range_set.
