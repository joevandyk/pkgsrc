The Document Object Model is a platform and language-neutral interface that
will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
structure and style of documents.

A DOM implementation (also called a host implementation) is that piece of
software which takes a parsed XML or HTML document and makes it available for
processing via the DOM interfaces. A browser contains a host implementation,
for example.
