PDF::Create allows you to create PDF documents using a large number of
primitives, and emit the result as a PDF file or stream.  PDF stands for
Portable Document Format.

Documents can have several pages, a table of content, an information
section and many other PDF elements. More functionalities will be added as
needs arise.

Documents are constructed on the fly so the memory foot-print is not tied to
the size of the pages but only to their number.
