`wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create
the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularly
useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
been refilled.

GNU `wdiff' has been written by Franc,ois Pinard.  It is an evolving
product, and specifications might change in future releases.
