  GtkSpell provides MSWord/MacOSX-style highlighting of misspelled words in
a GtkTextView widget as you type.  Right-clicking a misspelled word pops up
a menu of suggested replacements.

  GtkSpell depends on:

    * GTK+ 2.0 or greater.
    * Kevin Atkinson's pspell library.

GtkSpell is a library and is mostly of interest to GTK programmers.
