The RSS Abstraction Interface, or RAI (said "ray"), provides an
object-oriented interface to XML::RSS::Parser trees that abstracts
the user from handling namespaces, overlapping and alternate tag
mappings.

It's rather well known that, while popular, the RSS syntax is a
bit of a mess.

RAI provides a single simplified interface that maps one method
call to various overlapping and alternate tags used in RSS feeds.
The interface also abstracts developers from needing to deal with
namespaces. Method names are based on Dublin Core terminology.
