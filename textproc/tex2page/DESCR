TeX2page makes Web pages from TeX manuscripts. It reads an input
document that is marked up in a TeX format (viz., plain TeX, LaTeX,
Texinfo), and produces an output document with the functionally
equivalent HTML markup. TeX2page uses the same input file syntax,
calling conventions, and error-recovery mechanisms as TeX, and thus
demands no additional expertise of a user already familiar with
TeX. TeX2page runs on modern Schemes and Common Lisp.
