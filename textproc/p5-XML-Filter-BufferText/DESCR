This Perl 5 module is a very simple filter for XML parsers.  One
common cause of grief (and programmer error) is that XML parsers
aren't required to provide character events in one chunk. They can,
but are not forced to, and most don't. This filter does the trivial
but often-repeated task of putting all characters into a single event.
