The original Wiki web site was intended to have a very simple interface to
edit and to add pages.  Its formatting rules are simple and easy to use.

Text::WikiFormat helps in easily translating to other, more complicated
markup languages.  It creates HTML by default, but can be extended to
produce valid POD, DocBook, XML, or any other format imaginable.
