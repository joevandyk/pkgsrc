The Perl 5 module CAM::PDF reads and writes any document that
conforms to the PDF specification.
Other Perl modules implementing the PDF specification are optimized
for programatically creating new PDF documents from scratch. On
the contrary, CAM::PDF is optimized for reading and manipulating
existing PDF documents.
