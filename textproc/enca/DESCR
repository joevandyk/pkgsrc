Enca is an Extremely Naive Charset Analyser. It detects character
set and encoding of text files and can also convert them to other
encodings. The charset detecting functionality is also available as
a library.

Enca currently can determine 8bit charsets of Belarussian, Bulgarian,
Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish,
Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian, and Chinese texts and also
some multibyte encodings, independent on language (provided it's
some European language).
