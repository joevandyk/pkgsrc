c2html is a simple program which converts a C source code tree into
HTML which can be easily navigated using a web browser.

Features:
 * Colorized output
 * Hyperlinks between files are created for functions and, in some cases,
   macro definitions.
 * A file called .index can contain one-line comments about each file in a
   directory; it will be included in the HTML-ized directory listing.
 * HTML "header" and "footer" files can be included. href-links pointing
   to local files (relative to the current directory) are automatically
   updated.
 * A "web bug" can be included on each page.
