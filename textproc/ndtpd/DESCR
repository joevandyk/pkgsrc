NDTPD is a server for accessing CD-ROM books with NDTP (Network
Dictionary Transfer Protocol) on TCP.  You can replace dserver with
NDTPD.  NDTPD can run on UNIX derived systems.  It supports access
to CD-ROM books in EB, EBG, EBXA, and EPWING formats.  CD-ROM books
of those formats are popular in Japan.  Since CD-ROM books themselves
are in ISO 9660 format, you can mount the discs in the same way as
other ISO 9660 discs.
