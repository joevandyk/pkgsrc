Text::BibTeX is a Perl library for reading, parsing, and processing
BibTeX files.  It is the Perl half of btOOL, a pair of libraries for
dealing with BibTeX data; the C half, btparse, is needed to compile
Text::BibTeX.

Text::BibTeX gives you access to the data at many different levels: you
may work with BibTeX entries as simple "field -> string" mappings, or
get at the original form of the data as a list of simple values
(strings, macros, or numbers) pasted together.  You can impose no
restrictions on the allowed/expected entry types or fields, or you can
use the structure defined by BibTeX 0.99's standard style files, or you
can invent your own.
