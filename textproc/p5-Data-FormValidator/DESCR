Data::FormValidator's main aim is to make input validation expressible in a
simple format.

Data::FormValidator lets you define profiles which declare the required and
optional fields and any constraints they might have.

The results are provided as an object which makes it easy to handle missing
and invalid results, return error messages about which constraints failed, or
process the resulting valid data.
