  * search for matching word
  * words/phrases marked with { } in the dictionary definitions are recognized
    as hyper links and browseable

  * backward moving through the visited definitions
  * in the latest versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs you get support for popup
    menus
  * in GNU Emacs 21 and XEmacs 21 you can lookup words by simply pointing the
    mouse cursor to them (tool-tips)
  * supports HTTP proxies for port forwarding
  * supports dictionaries which are not encoded as utf-8
