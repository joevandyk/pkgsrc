XML::ValidWriter is a drop-in replacement for XML::Writer that uses
the DTD contained in an XML::Doctype to enable compile- and run-time
checks of XML output validity.  It also provides methods and functions
named after the elements mentioned in the DTD.

XML::AutoWriter is a subclass of XML::ValidWriter that provides
automatic start and end tag generation, allowing you to emit only the
"important" tags.
