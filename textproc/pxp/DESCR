PXP is a validating XML parser for O'Caml. It strictly complies to
the XML-1.0 standard.

The parser is simple to call, usually only one statement (function
call) is sufficient to parse an XML document and to represent it
as object tree.

Once the document is parsed, it can be accessed using a class
interface. The interface allows arbitrary access including
transformations. One of the features of the document representation
is its polymorphic nature; it is simple to add custom methods to
the document classes. Furthermore, the parser can be configured
such that different XML elements are represented by objects created
from different classes. This is a very powerful feature, because
it simplifies the structure of programs processing XML documents.

Note that the class interface does not comply to the DOM standard.
It was not a development goal to realize a standard API (industrial
developers can this much better than I); however, the API is powerful
enough to be considered as equivalent with DOM. More important,
the interface is compatible with the XML information model required
by many XML-related standards.
