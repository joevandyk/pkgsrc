What is KDOC?

KDOC is a C++ and IDL interface documentation tool, initially written
for the specific purpose of generating documentation for the KDE libraries.

KDOC extracts specially formatted documentation and information about
your classes from the class' header or IDL files, and generates
cross-referenced HTML, LaTeX or Man pages from it.

KDOC allows groups of classes to be formed into "libraries" and
documentation from separate libraries can be very easily
cross-referenced.
