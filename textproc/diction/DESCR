Diction  and  style  are  two  old  standard  UNIX  commands.  Diction
identifies  wordy and commonly misused phrases. Style analyses surface
characteristics  of  a  document,  including sentence length and other
readability measures.

These programs cannot help you structure a document well, but they can
help  to  avoid  poor  wording  and  compare  the readability (not the
understandability!)  of  your  documents  with  others.  Both commands
support English and German documents.
