XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.
XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped
by the module and convert it back to Perl.

This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files
using an XML format that can be reloaded or accessed by
other programs. Maybe even by other languages.
