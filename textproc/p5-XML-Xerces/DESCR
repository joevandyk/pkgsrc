XML::Xerces is the Perl API to the Apache project's Xerces XML parser.
It is implemented using the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to
most of the C++ API from Perl.

Because it is based on Xerces-C, XML::Xerces provides a validating XML
parser that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read
and write XML data.  Classes are provided for parsing, generating,
manipulating, and validating XML documents.  XML::Xerces is faithful
to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards (DOM levels
1,2, and 3, SAX 1 and 2, Namespaces, and W3C XML Schema).  The parser
provides high performance, modularity, and scalability, and provides
full support for Unicode.

XML::Xerces implements the vast majority of the Xerces-C API.  The
exception is some functions in the C++ API which either have better
Perl counterparts (such as file I/O) or which manipulate internal C++
information that has no role in the Perl module.

The majority of the API is created automatically using Simplified
Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG).  However, care has been taken to
make most method invocations natural to perl programmers, so a number
of rough C++ edges have been smoothed over.
