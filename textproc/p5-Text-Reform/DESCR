Text::Reform takes a series of format (or "picture") strings followed
by replacement values, interpolates those values into each picture
string, and returns the result.  The effect is similar to the inbuilt
perl format mechanism, although the field specification syntax is
simpler and some of the formatting behavior is more sophisticated.
