    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a fairly
    complete subset of LaTeX2e (old LaTeX style is also accepted) and the
    output language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 4.0 (transitional)

    Exotic symbols are translated into symbols pertaining to the
    symbol font of the HTML browser, using the FACE attribute of the FONT
    tag. This allows the translation to HTML of quite a lot of the symbols
    used in LaTeX.

    HEVEA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style
    files are understood with little or no modifications.
    Furthermore, HEVEA customization is done by writing LaTeX code.

    HEVEA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
    and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
    such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are
    translated as one single HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut
    into smaller files, using the companion program HACHA.
