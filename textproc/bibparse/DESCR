Bibparse, biblex, and bibunlex are programs for doing syntax checking
on BibTeX bibliography database files.

Biblex lexically analyzes BibTeX bibliography database files and
produces a lexical token stream from them.

Bibparse verifies a biblex or bibclean (available as a separate
package) lexical token stream or BibTeX database files.

Bibunlex reconstructs a BibTeX bibliography database file from
bibclean or biblex lexical analysis output.

Also included in this package is bibdup which checks for duplicate
abbreviations and entries in BibTeX bibliography database files.
