Increased reliance on optimistic data replication has led to
burgeoning interest in tools and frameworks for synchronizing
disconnected updates to replicated data.  To better understand the
issues underlying the design of generic and heterogeneous synchronizers,
we have implemented an experimental framework, called Harmony, that
can be used to build synchronizers for tree-structured data stored
in a variety of concrete formats, in particular XML.
