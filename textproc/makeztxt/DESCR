  makeztxt is a simple commandline program that takes a plain ASCII text
file and compresses it into a zTXT Palm database. It doesn't like the DOS
style CR/LF line breaks, so the input file should be first run through a
conversion program such as dos2unix if it contains such characters.
makeztxt will remove newline characters at the end of lines that contain
text so that the paragraphs flow better on the Palm screen.

  The best feature of makeztxt, however, is its ability to use regular
expressions to search the input text for bookmark spots.  This is done
with the command line options -l and -r:

	-l will list all the bookmarks that are generated.
	-r takes a regex as an argument to generate one or more
	   bookmarks. You can have as many -r options as you want.
