Matchbox is a GPL'd X11 window manager designed for computers with little
screen real estate, limited input devices and low CPU/storage resources.
Touchscreen PDAs, phones, set top boxes and even watches fit well into this
category.  Children or people with disabilities may also find matchbox useful
on desktop machines, due to the way it simplifies window operation.

Matchbox is small, fast, flexible, dependent only on xlib and very usable.

The Distribution also include various themes and utility programs, including
a dock (or tray) and various simple dock apps useful for PDAs.
