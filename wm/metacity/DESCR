Metacity is not a meta-City as in an urban center, but rather Meta-ness as in
the state of being meta.  i.e.  metacity :  meta as opacity :  opaque.  Also
it may have something to do with the Meta key on UNIX keyboards.

- Boring window manager for the adult in you.  Many window managers are like
  Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios.
- Uses GTK+ 2.0 for drawing window frames.  This means colors, fonts, etc.
  come from GTK+ theme.
- Has a simple theme system and a couple of extra themes come with it.
  Change themes via gconf-editor or gconftool:
    gconftool-2 --type=string --set /apps/metacity/general/theme Crux
- Change number of workspaces via gconf-editor or gconftool:
    gconftool-2 --type=int --set /apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces 5
  Can also change workspaces from GNOME 2 pager.
- Change focus mode:
    gconftool-2 --type=string --set /apps/metacity/general/focus_mode mouse
