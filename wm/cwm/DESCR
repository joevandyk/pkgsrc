cwm is a window manager for X11.  It was originally inspired by evilwm,
but was rewritten from scratch due to limitations in the evilwm codebase.
The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from 9wm.  cwm contains many
new features which all concentrate on the efficiency and transparency of
window management.  cwm also aims to maintain the most simplest and
pleasant aesthetic.
