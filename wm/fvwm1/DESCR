Fvwm is a very famous window manager for X, which provides a
virtual/multiple disjoint desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations,
shaped/color icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice
button-bar can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

This is the older, smaller version of fvwm; it uses not much more
than half the memory of version 2.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package and fvwm2 share a few files, in
particular the xpmroot program and the manual pages for the modules.
Don't install both at the same time, or be prepared to lose slightly
if you do and then uninstall one.
