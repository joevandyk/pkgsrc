Fvwm is a very famous window manager for X, which provides a
virtual/multiple disjoint desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations,
shaped/color icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice
button-bar can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

This package uses fvwm-users-jp-kits also, to add internationalized
feature (based on X itself) to fvwm and its modules.

With this package, you may use fonts of your own language, display
characters in everywhere in fvwm, and have fun ;-)
