What is 9wm?
============

9wm is an X window manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window
manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the constraints imposed by X.
It provides a simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish
decorations or title-bars. Or icons.  And it's click-to-type.  This
will not appeal to everybody, but if you're not put off yet then read
on.  (And don't knock it until you've tried it).

One major difference between 9wm and 8-1/2 is that the latter provides
windows of text with a typescript interface, and doesn't need to run a
separate program to emulate a terminal.  9wm, as an X window manager,
does require a separate program.  For better 8-1/2 emulation, you should
obtain Matthew Farrow's "9term" program (ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/matty/unicode),
version 1.6 or later (earlier versions don't cooperate with 9wm in
implementing "hold mode").  Of course, you can run xterm under 9wm as well.
