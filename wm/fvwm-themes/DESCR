fvwm2-themes gives to a novice fvwm2 user a complete fvwm2 configuration with
precreated themes. The user doesn't need to know any fvwm2 syntax to start
using a reasonably powerful and themeable fvwm2 setup. All he needs is to
install the latest fvwm2, the latest fvwm2-themes and start fvwm-themes-start.
On the other hand, fvwm2-themes gives to a more experience user an ability to
create his own personal parts (so called personal theme) to use with other
theme components or even to create a completely new theme.
