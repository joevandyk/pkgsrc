lwm is a window manager for X that tries to keep out of your face. There
are no icons, no button bars, no icon docks, no root menus, no nothing:
if you want all that, then other programs can provide it. There's no
configurability either: if you want that, you want a different window
manager; one that helps your operating system in its evil conquest of
your disc space and its annexation of your physical memory.
