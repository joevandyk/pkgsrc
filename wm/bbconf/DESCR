Welcome to bbconf, the all-in-one blackbox configuration tool.
Never heard of blackbox before? Well, let's just say that it's the
best Window Manager for X that's out "there" in our humble opinion.
Simply put, this little utility here has such lofty goals as being
the one place where you can configure anything and everything you
need to that has to do with blackbox.

bbconf aims to do that through the use of plugins--plugins which
allow you to configure anything you wish about blackbox or its
helper applications such as bbkeys, bbpager, bbapm, bbmail, bbpal,
etc.

bbconf is distributed with 4 plugins that allow you to configure
blackbox's keybindings, blackbox's styles/themes, and your blackbox
menus and submenus. The architecture of the plugins themselves are
very simple and elegant -- making it easy for anyone else to add
onto the distributed plugins to make it easy to configure whatever
else you want to for your blackbox/X sessions.
