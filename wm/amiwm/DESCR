amiwm is an X window manager that tries to make your display look and feel
like an Amiga Workbench screen. It is fully functional and can do all the
usual window manager stuff, like moving and resizing windows.

The purpose of amiwm is to make life more pleasant for Amiga-freaks who
has/wants to use UNIX workstations once in a while. It can also be used
on the Amiga with the AmiWin X server, although this part needs some more
work.
