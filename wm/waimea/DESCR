The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficient desktop
working environment available. To achieve this, waimea is a fast and
highly customizable virtual desktop window manager. It uses the blackbox
image rendering engine (blackbox styles support) and can use the Xft
library for font rendering (anti-aliased font support). It also features
a very advanced configuration system with which is possible to make waimea
behave as almost any other window manager.
