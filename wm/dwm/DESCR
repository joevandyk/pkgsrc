dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiling
and floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed. It
is the little brother of wmii.

dwm contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
mode, the title of the focused window, and the text read from standard
input. The selected tags are highlighted with a different color, the
tags of the focused window are highlighted with a small point.
