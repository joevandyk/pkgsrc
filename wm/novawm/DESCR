NovaWM is a window manager for the X Window System (X11). It is developed
with speed, size, and style in mind. NovaWM takes on its own style that
is different than any window manager.

NovaWM has its own toolkit that is much easier to understand and develop
with than most others, though NovaWM itself does not use the toolkit to
create its interface, reducing the dependency on other libraries.
