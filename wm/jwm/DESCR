JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System.
It provides a menu, taskbar, key binding, system notification tray,
pager, a dock, and simple customizations.  JWM is written in C and
uses only Xlib and the shape extension, libXpm and (optionally)
libpng. It can support some MWM, GNOME, and WM Spec hints.
