Metisse is an X-based window system designed with two goals in mind.
First, it should make it easy for HCI researchers to design and
implement innovative window management techniques Second, it should
conform to existing standards and be robust and efficient enough to be
used on a daily basis, making it a suitable platform for the
evaluation of the proposed techniques.

Metisse is not focused on a particular kind of interaction (e.g.  3D)
and should not be seen as a new desktop proposal.  It is rather a tool
for creating new types of desktop environments.
