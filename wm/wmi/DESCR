WMI is a new window manager for X11, which combines the best features of
LarsWM, Ion, TrsWM, evilwm and ratpoison into one window manager.

WMI is new: it is developed from scratch with C++ without any ancient code
and design dependencies to antiquated window managers.

WMI is minimalist: it has no build- or runtime dependencies except the C++
Standard Template Library (STL) and the X11 Library (XLib).

WMI is highly customizable: it is designed with keyboard users in mind. Each
action (e.g. resizing the frame, creating a new workspace, launching an app,
note that WMI provides hundreds of actions) can be bind to a shortcut. So say
good-bye to the rodent :)
