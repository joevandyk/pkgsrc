The Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory framework is for Perl Gtk2 developers who
(at least partially ;) agree with these statements:

* GUI programming is fun but often boring.

* A lot of tasks in GUI programming are similar and misleads the lazy
  programmer to do too much Copy'n Paste.

* RAD tools like Glade are fine for small applications but not if you
  want to have a consistent look and feel in bigger and modular
  applications.

Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory tries to help you with these issues by:

* Strictly separating GUI design, application logic and data structures.

* Giving the developer a more declarative style of defining the structure of
  your GUI.

* Giving the developer the possibility of definiting the design of the GUI
  at a single spot in your program.

* Being lightweight and easy to learn.
