Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention of
repetitive stress injuries. When you should take a break,
it pops up an X window, the warning window. You click on
the warning window, then take a break. The window changes
appearance while you take the break. It changes again when
your break is over. Then you click on the window and
resume typing. Xwrits hides itself until you should take
another break.
