The xkeyboard-config package provides a non-arch keyboard configuration
database for the X Window System with support for non-standard
keyboards, national layouts and options. The goal is to provide
the consistent, well-structured, frequently released open source
of X keyboard configuration data for free, open source and commercial
X implementations. The project is targeted to XKB-based systems.
