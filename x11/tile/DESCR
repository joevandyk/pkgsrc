This is a utility to tile windows on the desktop.  It supports user-
configurable window manager profiles to avoid screen objects and can
tile in a horizontal or vertical fashion.  It works well with MWM,
Oroborus and some multi-desktop WMs like FluxBox (given the -m option)
and GNOME/Metacity (given the -w option).

It has two files controlling its behavior.  The first contains
"wmprofiles" that tell tile how much space to avoid on the different
sides of the screen (specified via "-p"). The second, named "rc",
contains all other configuration, including a list of XA_STRING X11
Atoms and values used as criteria for windows that should be avoided
for calculations and resize/move operations.  Both files may exist
under $PREFIX/share/tile/ or $HOME/.tile/.
