This package provides four sample theme engines for GTK version 2:

* Pixmap: A generic engine that renders using pixmaps. One theme
  using this theme engine is included.

* Metal: A fairly complete theme engine that looks like the
  Java-Metal look of Swing.

* Redmond95: A simple theme engine that looks a bit like
  Microsoft Windows95.
