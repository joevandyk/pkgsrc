mlterm is a Multi Lingual TERMinal emulator for X.  It supports
many character sets, many encodings, and many other decorative
functions.  Since mlterm retains character tables in memory to
convert characters between UCS and other encodings, it consumes a
lot of memory while running, so it's recommended that you open
multiple ptys in one process.
