gnome-screensaver is a new screensaver that can replace xscreensaver.
It is designed to integrate well with the desktop and provide a control
interface that is desktop neutral.  It simplifies and streamlines the
experience for the user and provides more capability for the system
administrator and vendor.

It is designed to support:
* A desktop neutral control interface via DBus.
* A desktop neutral and standard way to install and manage screensaver
  themes.
* Switching users directly from the unlock dialog.
* Allowing a system administrator to set a mandatory policy for any setting.
* A secure separation of user input processing and authentication from the
  screen locking window.
* A separation between the screensaver theme engine and the theme settings.
* Integration with the desktop (themes, fonts, toolkit).
* Translation into many languages by the GNOME Translation Project.
* Instantly applying settings changes.
