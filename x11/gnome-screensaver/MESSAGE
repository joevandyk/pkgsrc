If gnome-screensaver is built with the "pam" option:
In order to make unlocking work, you need to add a
gnome-screensaver file to your pam configuration directory (usually
/etc/pam.d).  You can find sample files in:
	${EGDIR}/pam.d/gnome-screensaver-*
On  NetBSD, the "pam_pwauth_suid.so" module must be used to authenticate
against a shadow password database. Note that use of this module might
allow programs with your privileges to get a copy of your plaintext
password as typed in for unlocking.

The "floating feet" animation needs librsvg (from pkgsrc/graphics/librsvg)
to read its graphics file.
