xpad is a sticky notes application written using GTK+ 2.0 that strives to
be simple, fault-tolerant, and customizable. xpad consists of independent
pad windows; each is basically a text box in which notes can be written.
Despite being called xpad, all that is needed to run or compile it is the
GTK+ 2.0 libraries. Here is a list of major features in the current xpad
stable release:

 * GTK+ 2.0 powered text view.
 * Fault tolerant. All information is kept on the hard drive, not memory.
   So if power is lost or your computer freezes, there is little lost
   information.
 * xpad is very customizable. The color scheme (text, background, and window
   borders) and the font can be changed. These settings can be applied to
   one pad or set as the default for future pads. Want window decorations or
   not? Your choice.
 * A customizable toolbar puts the most frequently used commands at your
   fingertips.
 * Support for the X session management protocol.
 * Support for the www.freedesktop.org system tray proposal.
