# This is a script to construct the glimpse databases for tkman,
# and also the apropos databases shared by tkman, man, and xman.
# We don't do this as part of the package install because it could
# be very time-consuming. It is possible to simply run tkman as root,
# and exercise the menu option to "rebuild databases", but it could
# take a long time, and who wants to run an X app as root, anyway?
#
# You might run this on a weekly basis by adding the following
# entry to root's crontab (edited to taste):
#
# 10      2       *       *       6       @@PREFIX@@/libexec/mkindex

# Don't add /usr/local to the list unless there's something there,
# because an empty glimpse database will cause tkman to squawk.
