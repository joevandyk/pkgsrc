To allow this package to coexist with other versions of Qt
it has been installed in ${PREFIX}/qt4/{bin,include,lib,doc}.

You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by ensuring that

1) QTDIR is set to ${PREFIX}/qt4

2) Use the "configure" argument "--with-qt-dir=${PREFIX}/qt4"

3) you may also have to put ${PREFIX}/qt4/bin in your PATH

To access Qt-4 man pages add ${PREFIX}/qt4/doc/man to your MANPATH
environment variable.  Note that the Qt-4 man pages are installed
here to avoid conflicts with man pages of other Qt versions.
