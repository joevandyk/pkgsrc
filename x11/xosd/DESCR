XOSD is a simple library to display shaped text on your X display,
like a TV On Screen Display.  Aside from the library, this package
contains a simple example program that can display system logs
overlayed on your desktop.

The XOSD library requires an X Window System compiled with threading
support to work properly, particularly the Xlib library.
