This is my QwSpriteField class set for implementing efficiently redrawn
sprites in the Qt GUI Toolkit.

This directory contains all the sources for the QwSpriteField class set.

The documentation is in html/index.html

A trivial example is given in example.cpp

The sprite subdirectory is graphics for the example program.  It is
pregenerated, but if you have POVRAY 3.0 you can experiment with that
too.
