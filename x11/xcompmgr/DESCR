xcompmgr is a sample compositing manager for X servers supporting the
XFIXES, DAMAGE, and COMPOSITE extensions. It enables basic eye-candy
effects.

NOTE:  Running it with -FfCc gives nice-looking results.  Do not try this
without switching from XAA to EXA acceleration!  The composite
extension is virtually unusable with XAA.
