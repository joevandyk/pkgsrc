This package contains the gtkshell GUI creator, the gshterm vte-based terminal
emulator, a text editor, a simple IDE ideal for C development, and the ACE
sample desktop implementation. gtkshell allows one to create a gtk2 GUI
from the command line, by specifying widgets and options
at the command line.  gshterm is transparent vte-based terminal emulator.
ACE is a script which implements desktop features with gtkshell, including
a deskbar with a clock, a settings utility and configuration system,
a sticky notes applet, system monitors, a manual page browser, and configurable
launchers for applications.  gtkshell also provides GUIDL, the
GUI Definition Language parser for specifying static interface definitions.
Using gtkshell and the examples provided by ACE, one can rapidly construct
a GUI application, leaving the developer to focus on application logic.
