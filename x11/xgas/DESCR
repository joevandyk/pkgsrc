Xgas, animated simulation of an ideal gas

Xgas is a physical simulation of an ideal gas in a heated box.
Gas molecules move around the box with velocities dependent on
their temperature. A chamber consisting of two boxes contains
the gas molecules collide with the walls, their temperature
approaches that of the box.

Use  mouse  button  1 to create molecules one at a time at
the cursor position.  Use mouse button  2  to  create  the
maximum number of molecules at the cursor position.
