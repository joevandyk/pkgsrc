This package provides the X RandR Library from the modular X.org
X11 project.

This simple library is designed to interface with the X Resize,
Rotate, and Reflection Extension. This allows clients to change
the size and rotation of the root window of a screen, along with
the ability to reflect the screen about either axis.
