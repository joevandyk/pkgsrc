Release 2.0 of xp

xp started as a filter to simply display stdin in an Athena text
widget.  It grew to be a more general file displayer with an emphasis
on ease of browsing and searching, but I've tried to keep its interface
(and implementation) simple and make it useful in shell scripts.

xp tries to be reasonably efficient in use of memory when displaying
large files, given that the text widgets requires the whole file to be
in memory, by using a read-only text widget and freeing memory when a
file is no longer displayed (so if you go back to a previously
displayed file it gets re-opened).

xp incorporates Henry Spencer's implementation of egrep style regular
expression matching. The xp distribution includes that part of the
regexp distribution which it requires.
