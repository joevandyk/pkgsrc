9term is a terminal emulator which emulates an 8 1/2 window.
this version supports unicode.  To see this support, cat one of
the utf files in an 8 1/2 window.  Your Xserver must be able to
find the required fonts, and the `*p9font' x-resource must be
set to point to the fonts, maybe `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Xg/unicode.9.font'.

This port needs work, it is functional enough to get the feel
for 9term, but some of the features don't work with FreeBSD.
