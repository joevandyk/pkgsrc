Qt Designer accelerates GUI application development and maintenance by
offering a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) drag and drop interface
for UI creation and maintenance. Qt Designer employs a vendor neutral,
XML-format for persistent storage, which simplifies the tasks involved
with the creation and layout of dialogs.
