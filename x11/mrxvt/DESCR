Mrxvt (previously named as materm) is a lightweight and powerful
multi-tabbed X terminal emulator based on the popular rxvt and aterm.
It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal
emulators, like gnome-terminal and konsole, but keeps to be
lightweight and independent from the GNOME and KDE desktop
environment.
