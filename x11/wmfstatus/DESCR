WMFstatus for WindowMaker (dockapp)

It is a very usefull general purpose 8x5 LCD screen. It can show any
information you provide manually or generate by some script/program.
Can monitor anything, starting with number of new messages in inbox
and ending with number of unread articles on Slashdot. I myself use
two instances of wmfstatus to see number of unread mails in the big
number of folders I have.
