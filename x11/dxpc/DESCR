dxpc is an X protocol compressor designed to improve the
speed of X11 applications run over low-bandwidth links
(such as dialup PPP connections).

dxpc consists of two processes:
1. a Client Proxy that runs on the "remote" machine (the machine where
   the X clients are running)
2. a Server Proxy that runs on the "local" machine (the machine where
   the X server is running)
