This program is a contribution to the community of greek UNIX users. It makes
it possible to change keyboard mapping with alt-shift or meta-shift
combinations or by clicking on the flag image.  You will be able to write
greek in X programs like netscape or xedit. You must have the greek fonts,
which are not provided with this package.

Keycodes are auto-loaded on startup so it should work with all unices and
keyboard layouts.
