Qt Architect is a graphical dialog editor for the Qt widget set.  It
allows for the graphical creation and placement of widgets onto a
dialog.  Various properties for the widget can also be set.  Widgets
may be mapped to variables so that you can control them once the
dialog is launched.  After the dialog is created on the screen, the
files for the dialog are created.
