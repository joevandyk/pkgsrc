You probably want to make sure that directory /tmp/.ICE-unix is created
with owner root and mode 1777 prior to starting KDE.

If this isn't done, under some circumstances KDE startup will fail or if
it does work the directory will be owned by the first KDE user potentially
allowing them to delete subsequent users ICE sockets.
