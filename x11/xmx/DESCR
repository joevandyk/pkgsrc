XMX is a standalone utility for sharing an X Window System session on
multiple X displays.  It allows users to see and interact with the
same applications at the same time from different locations.  XMX
takes advantage of the networked nature of the X Window System by
acting as an intermediary between X clients and X servers.  In this
way, XMX works with any X clients and any X servers, without the need
to modify either.

XMX provides a WYSIWIS (What You See Is What I See) environment; it
paints the same graphics on all participating displays.  The shared
client applications appear to each participant in a virtual root
window which is subject to local window management.  In this way, the
shared X session coexists with each user's private X session.

The X client applications which are shared via XMX are unaware that
they are being viewed or controlled by more than one user.  Existing,
single-user X client applications may be shared using XMX without
recompilation, relinking or access to source code.

XMX is designed as an application sharing server.  It provides both
the mechanism of application sharing and a way to control the shared
session from other programs.  Like X, it leaves policy decisions to
application programs.  In this way, XMX may be used as a component in
any of a variety of systems that require application sharing.
