aterm is a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on rxvt 2.4.8 with
Alfredo Kojima's additions of fast transparency, intended as an
xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require features such as
Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability.  As a
result, aterm uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on
a machine serving many X sessions.

It was created with AfterStep Window Manger users in mind, but is not
tied to any libraries, and can be used anywhere.
