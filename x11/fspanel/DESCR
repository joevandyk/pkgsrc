FSPanel is a panel for Linux/Unix that lists all your open windows. It
lets you iconify and bring windows to front. FSPanel is tiny, less than
10k on i386-linux. It does require a EWMH compliant window manager
though (eg. Enlightenment, SawFish, WindowMaker, IceWM).

Basically it's a tiny, lame, featureless panel. It doesn't provide
program launchers, menus, nor applets.
