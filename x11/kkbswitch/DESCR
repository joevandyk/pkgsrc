KKBSwitch is a keyboard layout indicator for KDE 2 or 3.
It is useful when you have configured the XKeyboard extension
of your X Server to have more than one keyboard group (layout),
for example US/ASCII and Russian. KKBSwitch displays an icon
in the system tray that indicates which layout is currently active.
Note that KKBSwitch does not help you configure XKeyboard,
it merely serves as the indicator of the current layout.
You still have to configure XKeyboard by editing the XF86Config file.
