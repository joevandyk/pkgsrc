The X Fixes Extension provides workarounds for various limitations
in the core protocol.  The extension is designed to hold various
vaguely related extension bits that change how the X server and
clients interact with fundamental parts of the window system.

This package provides the libXFixes library from the modular X.org
X11 project.
