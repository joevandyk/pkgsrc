Please note that this package is provided for those programs
which will not work with newer versions of Qt.  To allow this
package to coexist with newer versions of Qt, it has been installed
in ${PREFIX}/qt1/{bin,include,lib,man}.

You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by ensuring that

1) QTDIR is set to ${PREFIX}/qt1

2) Use the "configure" argument "--with-qt-dir=${PREFIX}/qt1"

3) you may also have to put ${PREFIX}/qt1/bin in your PATH
