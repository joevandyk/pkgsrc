This is a patched version of xorg's transset
I wanted to integrate transset into my windowmanager and to
be able to set and unset transparency by just pressing a key.
To make that possible I added several different 'select methods'.
The first one was 'select by point' and lets the user run transset
directly on the window curently under the cursor without bringing
up the crosshair. Later select by name and id was added after insperation
from other transset patches.
