As the name suggests, this little program lets you change your Gtk+
2.0 theme.  The aim is to make theme preview and selection as slick as
possible.  Themes installed on the system are presented for selection
and previewed on the fly.  For a comprehensive demonstration there's a
large variety of widgets.
