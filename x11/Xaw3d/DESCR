This is a set of 3-D widgets based on the R6.1 Athena Widget set.
The Three-D Athena may be used as a general replacement for the
Athena (Xaw) Widget set.

In general, you may relink almost any Athena Widget based application
with the Three-D Athena Widget set and obtain a three dimensional
appearance on some of the widgets. On systems with shared libraries,
you can usually replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d and obtain
the three dimensional appearance without even relinking.
