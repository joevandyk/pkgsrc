This utility displays the contents of the rgb.txt file (usually found
as /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt) or a file with this format specified as
the optional [RgbTxtFile] parameter. Each line of this file consists
of 3 integers (usu ally 0-255) representing the RGB values and a
nickname for this color separated by spaces. The RGB values can be
displayed in every color representation X11R5/6 supports.  Also it is
possible to show the values in either resource definition or
C-style. An additional option to display the RGB values the current
server would be able to actu ally display is also implemented. The
main feature of Xcolorsel is that a small example tile of each color
is also shown.
