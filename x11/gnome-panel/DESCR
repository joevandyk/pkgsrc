The package contains the GNOME panel which the area on your desktop
from which you can run applications and applets, and perform other
tasks.

The libpanel-applet library is also in this package. This library
allows one to develop small applications which may be embedded in
the panel. These are called applet.

Several applets are also supplied - the Workspace Switcher, the
Window List, the Inbox Monitor, the Clock and the infamous `Wanda
the Fish'.
