XFlame is a cool little graphics hack originally made by the Rasterman
and modified by me, Rahul Jain.

It does what you would expect it to do, draw a flame on the screen.

FEATURES:
* User-settable window size
* User-settable color spectrum
* Frame rate limiting so you can still crack RC5 keys in the background :)
  (default 10 fps)
* Option to draw to the root window
* Single pass, 2 pass (default), and 4 pass interlacing
* Option to draw only the changed portion of the image to the screen in 8
  bit color only, resulting in a massive increase in speed w/ large windows
  (e.g., root window).
* Colormap niceness options
* Swallow-able into FVWM2's Button Bar
