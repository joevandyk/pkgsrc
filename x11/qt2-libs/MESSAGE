To allow this package to coexist with other versions of Qt
it has been installed in ${PREFIX}/qt2/{bin,include,lib,doc}.

You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by ensuring that

1) QTDIR is set to ${PREFIX}/qt2

2) Use the "configure" argument "--with-qt-dir=${PREFIX}/qt2"

3) you may also have to put ${PREFIX}/qt2/bin in your PATH

To access Qt-2 man pages add ${PREFIX}/qt2/doc/man to your MANPATH
environment variable.  Note that the Qt-2 man pages are installed
here to avoid conflicts with man pages of other Qt versions.
