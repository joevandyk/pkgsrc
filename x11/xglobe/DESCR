XGlobe displays the earth as seen from space on your X Desktop,
similar to xearth by Kirk Lauritz Johnson. The code to calculate
the sun's position was taken from this program. The image of the
globe is updated at regular intervals. XGlobe uses a world map
image which is mapped to the globe. With a good map this can look
very nice.  It is possible to mark locations on the globe.
