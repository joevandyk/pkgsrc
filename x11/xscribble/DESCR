Xscribble is an X application that allows a user of a touch screen
to input characters into X applications, using a uni-stroke (graffiti
like) alphabet. It uses the X test extension to allow synthesis of
characters as though they had been typed on a keyboard. It is the
X version of the scribble program.

As this program is "familiar" to Palm users, even if other, better
recognizers become available, it is important that we have a good
implementation of this recognition system..
