Ebuilder features:
------------------
- Allows creation of either a QWidget or a QDialog (modal or modeless).
- Provides a hierarchal view that shows the parent-child relations of the Qt
  widgets in your design
- Uses unmodified Qt widgets to create your design. This means that your
  design looks exactly like the final implementation.
- Load and save capability using a text file format.
- Exports C++ header (.h) and implementation (.cc) files that compile
  without modification. The header file contains a single class declaration
  for your design.
- Allows the definition of member functions, SLOTs, SIGNALs and member
  variables from within the program. It is possible to add code to the
  constructor and destructor of the class.
- Allows you to add extra includes to your design. You may need this for
  member variables or simply to use the iostream classes.
- Allows you to modify most, if not all, properties of the widgets in your
  design through a tabdialog.
