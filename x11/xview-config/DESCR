What Is XView
-------------
XView (X Window-System-based Visual/Integrated Environment for Workstations)
is a user-interface toolkit to support interactive, graphics-based
applications running under the X Window System.  XView provides a set of
pre-built, user-interface objects such as canvases, scrollbars, menus, and
control panels.  The appearance and functionality of these objects follow
the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface (GUI) specification.  XView features
an object-oriented style Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is
straightforward and easy to learn.

This package contains all the configurations files needed for use of
the XView libraries and applications.
