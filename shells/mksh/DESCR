mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell
(pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely similar to the
original AT&T Korn shell.  It includes bug fixes and feature improvements
in order to produce a modern, robust shell good for interactive and
especially script use.
