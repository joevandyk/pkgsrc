PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike.  Work is mostly
finished to make it fully compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh
(when the two don't conflict). Since pdksh is free and compiles
and runs on most common unix systems, it is very useful in creating
a consistent user interface across multiple machines.
