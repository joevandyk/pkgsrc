   `esh' was primarily written out of a need for a simple and
lightweight shell for Unix. As such, it deviates completely from all of
the traditional shells, opting instead for a Lisp-like syntax. This
allows exceptionally small size, both in terms of lines of code and
memory consumption, while retaining remarkable flexibility and
programmability.
