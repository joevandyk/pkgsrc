Is there any reason why a shell (or command line) cannot be as
tolerant or as intelligent as a text adventure game like Zork, or a
MUD (Multi User Dungeon)? Is there any reason why a shell cannot work
like such a game? ("Go North", etc.)

Actually, the answer is no and this is a perl implementation to prove it.
Have fun, and don't get eaten by a Grue!
