scponly is an alternative shell for system administrators who would like to
allow remote users to both read and write local files without providing any
remote execution privileges.

The only commands allowed are "scp" (for ssh1), "sftp-server" (for ssh2") and
"ls".  Arguments to these commands are passed along unmolested.
