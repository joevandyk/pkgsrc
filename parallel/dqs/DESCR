The Distributed Queueing System is designed as a management tool to
aid in computational resource distribution across a network.  DQS
provides architecture transparency for both users and administration
across a heterogeneous environment, allowing for seamless interaction
for multiple architectures.  Highly mutable custom site configurations
are possible under DQS.  This ability to customize DQS leads to
effective resource distribution and increased network throughput.
