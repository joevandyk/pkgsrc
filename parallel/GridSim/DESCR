GridSim is a toolkit for modeling and simulation of parallel and distributed
systems such as Clusters and Grids. GridSim is part of the Gridbus Project
(http://www.gridbus.org/).

The GridSim Toolkit includes:

* GridBroker:
  It is Grid scheduler built on top of GridSim for application
  scheduling on Grid based on Deadline and Budget Constrained
  Scheduling Algorithms.

* GridSim:
  It is built on top of SimJava. SimJava is a process based discrete
  event simulation package for Java with animation facilities.

* Visual Modeler:
  It enables the user to create experiments on different Grid testbeds
  and generate the default Grid Broker source codes (in Java).
