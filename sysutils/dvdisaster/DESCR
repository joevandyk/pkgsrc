CD and DVD media keep their data only for a finite time (typically for
many years). After that time, data loss develops slowly with read errors
growing from the outer media region towards the inside.

Dvdisaster stores data on CD/DVD in a way that it is fully recoverable
even after some read errors have developed. This enables you to rescue
the complete data to a new medium.

Data loss is prevented by using error correcting codes. Error correction
data is either added to the medium or kept in separate error correction
files. dvdisaster works at the image level so that the recovery does not
depend on the file system of the medium. The maximum error correction
capacity is user-selectable.
