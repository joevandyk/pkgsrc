  Whowatch is an interactive who-like program that displays
information about the users currently logged on to the machine, in
real time.  Besides standard informations (login name, tty, host,
user's process), the type of the connection (ie. telnet or ssh) is
shown.  You can toggle display between users' command or idle time.
You can watch processes tree, navigate in it and send INT and KILL
signals.
