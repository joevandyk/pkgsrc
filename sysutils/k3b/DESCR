K3b is a CD and DVD burning application for Linux and BSD systems
optimized for KDE. It provides a comfortable user interface to perform
most CD/DVD burning tasks like creating an Audio CD from a set of audio
files or copying a CD. The actual burning in K3b is done by the command
line utilities cdrecord, cdrdao, and growisofs.
