Lavaps is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'', but
with a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of
specific info in digital form, it tries to present certain important
information in a graphical analog form. The idea is that you can run
it in the background and get a rough idea of what's happening to your
system without devoting much concentration to the task.
