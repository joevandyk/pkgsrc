Libirman is a programming library for Irman control of Unix software.

Infrared man (Irman) is a small device that allows you to control
your PC with the remote from your TV, VCR, CD or Stereo. Irman
can be used in many ways, for example to control a software program
while you are in another room. Imagine controlling Winamp with a
normal remote to choose exactly the song you want. Or watching
DVD from your couch while still being able to pause or fast forward.
