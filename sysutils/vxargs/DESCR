vxargs is an utility inspired in xargs and pssh.  It provides a parallel
versions of any arbitrary command, including ssh, rsync, scp, wget or
curl, just to mention a few.

It is specially useful to control a large set of machines in a wide-area
network.  For example, it can be used on PlanetLab to control hundreds of
machines spread around the world.

Its main features are:
* Parallelism: Runs many jobs at the same time.
* Flexibility: Runs arbitrary commands with arbitrary options.
* Visualization: Monitors the total/per job progress in a curses-based UI.
* Redirection: The standard and error outputs of each individual job are
  redirected to local files for further analysis.
