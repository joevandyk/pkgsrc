.Dt ADJUSTKERNEL 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm adjustkernel
.Nd generate kernel config from dmesg
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm adjustkernel
.Op Fl dmor
.Op Fl -debug
.Op Fl -mesg Ar dmesg-file
.Op Fl -outfile Ar new-config
.Op Fl -remove
.Ar kernel-config
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates a new kernel configuration file from the
current dmesg output and the current kernel config file,
.Ar kernel-config .
.Pp
The generation can be customized by using the following options:
.Bl -tag -width 22n -compact
.It Fl d , Fl -debug
be verbose and generate noise (mainly useful for debugging).
.It Fl o Ar new-config , Fl -outfile Ar new-config
saves the newly generated config file to
.Ar new-config ;
otherwise the new config will be written to stdout.
.It Fl m Ar dmesg-file , Fl -mesg Ar dmesg-file
read the dmesg data from
.Ar dmesg-file ,
defaults to calling
.Pa /sbin/dmesg
and using its output.
See
.Pa /var/run/dmesg.boot
for an alternative snapshot from
right after the system booted, but which may not include
any removable components added later.
.It Fl r , Fl -remove
causes the tool to remove entries in the config file instead
of commenting them out.
.El
.Pp
Note that options can be shortened, as long as they can be
unambigously distinguished.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To generate a new kernel config
.Pa MYCONFIG
after having booted a
GENERIC kernel, run:
.Bd -literal
$ cd /usr/src/sys/arch/`uname -m`/conf
$ adjustkernel GENERIC >MYCONFIG
.Ed
.Pp
To see what could be stripped off the currently-running kernel,
assuming it was built with the
.Dq INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
option, use something like:
.Bd -literal
$ config -x >MYKERNEL
$ adjustkernel -r MYKERNEL | diff -u MYKERNEL - | more
.Ed

.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr dmesg 8
.Sh AUTHORS
Originally created by Hubert Feyrer <hubert@feyrer.de>,
later hacked in shape and packetized by Martin J. Laubach <mjl@netbsd.org>.
.Sh BUGS
Essential lines
.Dq atabus* at ata? ,
.Dq atapibus* at atapi? ,
and
.Dq scsibus* at scsi?
are removed as they aren't listed in
.Xr dmesg 8
output.
