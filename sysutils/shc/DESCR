shc creates a stripped binary executable version of a shell script.

shc itself is not a compiler such as cc, but rather it encodes and
encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with the added
expiration capability. It then uses the system compiler to compile a
stripped binary which behaves exactly like the original script. Upon
execution, the compiled binary will decrypt and execute the code with
the shell -c option.
