Many system administrators don't know exactly what logs they have until they
have looked into the question. Often, logging was enabled by defaults -- or by
previous system administrators -- and so your systems may be keeping logs you
never intended. logfinder is a tool created as a simple means of locating
files that might be logs on an existing system. logfinder uses regular
expressions to find local files with "log-like" contents; you can customize
those expressions if necessary to meet your needs.
