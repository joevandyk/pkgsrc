rsnapshot is a filesystem backup utility based on rsync.

Using rsnapshot, it is possible to take snapshots of your filesystems
at different points in time. Using hard links, rsnapshot creates the
illusion of multiple full backups, while only taking up the space of
one full backup plus differences. When coupled with ssh, it is possible
to take snapshots of remote filesystems as well.
