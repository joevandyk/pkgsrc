`skill' is a program which sends signals to processes given
any combination of user names, ttys, commands, and pids.  `snice' is
a program which changes the priority of processes (given the same).
It's actually one program which examines argv to determine what action
is to be taken on matching processes.  It is similar to kill(1) and
renice(8), however the command line is completely order independent.
There are also verbose, search, and interactive modes of operation.

The name `skill' stems from `SuperKILL', but if you use it under `csh',
you may discover another reason for calling it `skill' (hint "s!!").
