xapply (Extended Apply) is an clever derivative of xargs and apply.
Using list or tabular input from one or more descriptors, xapply executes
a template command modified for each input.  It supports simple split
on token expression, and has support (a la make -j) for running many
jobs in parallel.

Note that as far as anyone can tell, this is no longer maintained.
It may not build on every system pkgsrc supports.
