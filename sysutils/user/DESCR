The usermgmt suite of programs provides SVR4/Solaris-compatible
{user,group}{add,del,mod} commands, and two utilities, user(8) and
group(8) which perform the same functions.  In addition, some extensions
are provided, which allow a user to be created with the same uid and
gid, for example.

The usermgmt suite was based on the old addnerd package, which, in turn,
was based on Matt Green's addbozo script.
