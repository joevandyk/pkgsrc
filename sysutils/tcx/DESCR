TCX is a system designed for the transparent decompression, execution
and recompression of executables under Unix.  It allows configuration
options such as the type of compression system used (compress(1),
gzip(1), your own local system etc), timeouts between recompressions,
and emergency directories in case a decompression fails from shortage
of disk space.  The system is designed with a reasonable amount of
robustness in mind, such as in the event of system crashes, or races
on trying to uncompress, compress or execute something.
