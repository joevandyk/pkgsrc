  Burn.app is a GNUstep based CD burning program.  It serves as front-end
for Joerg Schilling's cdrtools (cdrecord and mkisofs), cdrdao, and
cdparanoia.  You will no longer need to remember ugly command line
parameters for cdrecord or write shell scripts.

  With Burn.app you compile your CD by point-and-click operation and save
your projects for later reuse.  Burn.app will hide as many settings as
possible from you, thus making it very easy and user-friendly to create
your own CDs.
