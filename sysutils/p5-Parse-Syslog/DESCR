Unix syslogs are convenient to read for humans but because
of small differences between operating systems and things
like 'last message repeated xx times' not very easy to parse
by a script.

Parse::Syslog presents a simple interface to parse syslog
files: you create a parser on a file (with new) and call
next to get one line at a time with Unix-timestamp, host,
program, pid and text returned in a hash-reference.
