Sysinfo displays various types of information about a host's hardware
and operating system software.  It is intended to provide information
in both human-readable and program-parsable formats.  System
administrators can use sysinfo to obtain hardware asset information
and OS configuration information.  Programs which use sysinfo can
obtain this information in a platform-independent manner.
