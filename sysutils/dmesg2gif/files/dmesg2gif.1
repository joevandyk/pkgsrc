.Nd output
.Xr dmesg 8
device tree as GIF image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
\*[Lt] /var/run/dmesg.boot | xv -
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes as input the kernel configuration messages that
are printed during boot.
Then it computes the device tree and passes it to
.Xr dot 1
to produce a GIF image of that tree.
You can either save the output into a file or pass it to
an image viewer, such as
.Xr xv 1 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/dmesg.boot
.It Pa /var/run/dmesg.boot
The initial output of
.Xr dmesg 8
is saved in this file immediately after booting.
These messages may later be overwritten by the kernel.
