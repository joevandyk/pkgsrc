GRUB is the GRand Unified Bootloader.  Briefly, bootloader is the
first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is
responsible for loading and transferring control to the operating
system kernel software (such as NetBSD or Linux).  GRUB understands
ffs, FAT{16,32}, ext2fs, ReiserFS, minixfs, and VSTafs.  It can
directly boot NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux without any other
bootloader, loading a.out and ELF kernels from the disk and passing
along necessary arguments (in most cases).  It can also boot any
operating system (the above, plus e.g. Windows, OS/2) by chaining
to that operating system's specific loader.  Grub features a runtime
command line and loads its configuration at boot rather than
requiring rerunning of a separate utility.  Other features are TFTP
booting, serial console support, large disk support, support for
both DOS MBR label and BSD disklabel simultaneously, booting from
hard drive or floppy.

GRUB is available for the i386 architecture only.
