If your root filesystem is of a type not supported directly by grub
(e.g., lfs), you may have difficulties.  See the info docs for more
details.

GRUB is not actually installed on your disk until you run a command
such as
	grub-install /dev/wd0d
or
	grub-install '(hd0)'

To boot NetBSD, put something similar to these lines into /grub/menu.lst:

	title NetBSD
	root (hd0,0,a) 	     # NetBSD on 1st MBR partition of 1st IDE disk
	chainloader +1

Alternatively, for NetBSD 4.x kernels and above, you can use the following
provided that your kernel was built with "options MULTIBOOT" (the default):

	title NetBSD
	root (hd0,0,a) 	     # NetBSD on 1st MBR partition of 1st IDE disk
	kernel /netbsd
