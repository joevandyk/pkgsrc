This package installs "xhfs", an elegant graphical browser for HFS
(Apple Macintosh) volumes. Also "hfs", a command line interface, and
"hfssh", the Tcl program that drives them both. The latter enables
scripted manipulation of HFS volumes using the powerful Tcl language.

This is the Tcl/Tk portion of Robert Leslie's hfsutils. The traditional
command line tools may be found in the systutils/hfsutils package.
