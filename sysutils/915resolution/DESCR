915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series
Intel graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G, 855G, and 865G chipsets,
as well as 915G, 915GM, and 945G chipsets. This modification is neccessary
to allow the display of certain graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86
graphics server.
915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient. There is no risk
of permanent modification of the BIOS. This also means that 915resolution
must be run every time the computer boots in order for it's changes to
take effect.
915resolution is derived from the tool 855resolution. However, the code
differs substantially. 915resolution's code base is much simpler.
915resolution also allows the modification of bits per pixel.
