This package contains three little utilities that use the proc FS:

  killall   kills processes by name, e.g. killall -HUP named
  pidof	    like killall, buts lists PIDs instead of killing processes
  pstree    shows the currently running processes as a tree

The Linux version includes "fuser" for listing processes' open files,
but NetBSD's procfs doesn't have the facilities for this (use
fstat(1) or the lsof package instead).
