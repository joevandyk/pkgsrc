This tool is to be used to measure different kinds of streams, the
idea is to create a good source to get concepts and resources for
other tools that measure system usage.

You can measure by how many KB/s a file received by FTP or NetCat
grows, for example.  How fast processes eat memory, stream usage
(pipe like), etc.
