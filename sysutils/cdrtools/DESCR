Cdrecord allows you to burn CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder. It
works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord supports
CD recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and
ATAPI/mmc compliant drives should also work.  Supported features
include: IDE/ATAPI, parallel-port, and SCSI drives; audio CDs, data
CDs, and mixed CDs; full multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable),
TAO, DAO, and human-readable error messages.

This package also provides tools for retrieving audio tracks,
reading and writing CDs, creating ISO9660/JOLIET/HFS filesystems,
and verifying ISO9660 images.
