safetynet allows you to monitor and restart processes without having to
write large and complicated init scripts. The config file is easy to
understand and learn and you can have the whole script setup and running
in under 10m, so you can get on with doing more important things than
worrying if your ssh daemon is still running.

You will probably want to add a crontab entry for root
(crontab -e as root) such as
0,15,30,45 * * * * ${PREFIX}/bin/safetynet --cron
which will cause the script to be run every 15 minutes.
