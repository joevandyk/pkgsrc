iDesk gives users of minimal window managers (like fluxbox, pekwm,
windowmaker...) icons on their desktop.  The icon graphics are either
from a PNG or SVG (vector) file and support some eyecandy effects like
transparency.  Each icon can be configured to run one or more shell
commands and the actions which run those commands are completely
configurable.  In a nutshell if you want icons on your desktop and you
don't have or don't want KDE or GNOME doing it, you can use idesk.
