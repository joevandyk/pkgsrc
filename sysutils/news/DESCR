The news utility prints news items stored in /var/news.  When invoked
without any arguments, news prints the name and timestamp of each current
item followed by its contents, most recent first.  An item is considered
``current'' if it has a modification time newer than the file
~/.news_time, a file that news creates if it does not exist.  If that
file does exist, news will update the timestamp on that file each time it
is run.

This version of the System V news utility was written by Jan Schaumann
<jschauma@NetBSD.org> following the manual page from an IRIX system.
