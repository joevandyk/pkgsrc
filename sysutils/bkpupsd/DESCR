This is a simple uninterruptible power source (UPS) daemon which
supports BKPro(TM) and BK UPS(TM) series by APC, and FREQUPS F series
by Mitsubishi Electric Corp.

Bkpupsd works as UPS monitor, sensing line-failures, shutting down the
system cleanly, and finally shutting down the UPS itself.

This UPSd provides only the "dumb mode", and the advanced features are
not supported.
