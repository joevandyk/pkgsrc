memtest is a utility for testing the memory subsystem in a computer
to determine if it is faulty. The original source was by Simon
Kirby <sim@stormix.com>. Charles Cazabon has by this time completely
rewritten the original source, and added many additional tests to
help catch borderline memory. He also rewrote the original tests
(which catch mainly memory bits which are stuck permanently high
or low) so that they run approximately an order of magnitude faster.
