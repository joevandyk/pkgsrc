Strace is a diagnostic and troubleshooting tool for printing out a trace
of all the system calls made by another process.  It intercepts and
records the signals received by a process and the system calls which
are called by a process.  The name of each system call, its arguments
and its return value are reported.

This version of strace is maintained by Wichert Akkerman.
