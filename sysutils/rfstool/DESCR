RFSTOOL - ReiserFS for Windows - allows you to access ReiserFS
partitions from a Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP system.  Starting with
version 0.6, it even allows you to access ReiserFS partitions from
Linux ;).  It is a complete rewrite of the ReiserFS functions needed
to list directories or access files.  Requirements

+ This tool was developed on NT/2000.  The current version has
support for Windows NT, 2000, XP, as well as the 16-bit products
Windows 95, 98 and ME.

+ For NT/2000/XP:  You need administrative privileges to run this
program.  Normal users will probably not have the access rights
to the raw partition data.

+ You need to know the drive and partition index of the ReiserFS
partition you want to read.  Luckily, the new version includes
an autodetect feature

+ Access is read-only.  I do not intend to change that, at least
for the time being.

+ Journal data is ignored.  These tools show the file structure as
it is ON DISK, right now.
