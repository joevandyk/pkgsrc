By default, the Webmin server listens on port 10000, e.g. it may be
accessed at:

	https://localhost:10000/

The default username and password for this Webmin installation is:

	Username: admin
	Password: password

It is highly recommended that this be changed as soon as possible,
either by logging into the Webmin server and changing it within the
"Webmin Users" module, or by using the changepass.pl script, e.g.,

	${WEBMIN_DIR}/changepass.pl \
		${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} admin new-password
