A bit of background on crashme. It is a tool for testing the robustness
of an operating environment using a technique of "Random Input" response
analysis. This I first saw formally proposed in the book Cybernetics
by Norbert Wiener, but which any parent who has observed his children
playing and learning would be well disposed to describe in detail.

* The operating environment under consideration is the user-mode process.

* The Random Input is provided by the execution of a sequence of pseudo-random
  data as an instruction stream.

* The response analysis is to catch and record machine and software
  generated exceptions/errors/signals and to retry using new random data
  in both the current user-mode process and in newly created subprocesses.
