tob is a general driver for making and maintaining backups.

Given a set of `volume definitions', it creates arj, tar or afio based
backups, and stores them either to a device in /dev, or a file in the
filesystem, to be burned to optical media later, moved off to other
machines, etc.  Through a straightforward configuration file, you can
instruct tob to mount and unmount devices before beginning backups.

tob supports full backups, differential backups (of the files which
were changed since the last full backup), and incremental backups (of
files changed since any previous backups).  It lets you determine the
size of the backup before actually making it, maintain listings of
made backups, make remote backups and possibly more.
