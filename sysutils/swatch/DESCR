Swatch was originally written to actively monitor messages as they are
written to a log file via the UNIX syslog utility. For a simple
demonstration type "perl swatch --examine=FILENAME" with FILENAME being
the file that you would like to see the contents of. All this example
will do is demonstrate the different text modes that are available with
to the echo action.
