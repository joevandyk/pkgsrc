fix4SA110rev2 modifies arm32 binaries in an attempt to work around
StrongARM rev2 problems

It attempts to identify the instructions that will cause problems
and moves them to a safe location.  The "safe" location is final
page of the text (code) segment of the executable, which normally
has some spare bytes before the start of the data segment.  Having
moved the instruction, it then puts a branch to the new location
where the old instruction used to be so that things will continue
to work.
