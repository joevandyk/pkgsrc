This package allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the
well-known mtools package, which accesses MSDOS file systems. I use it
for file exchange with a Z80-PC simulator, but it works on floppy
devices as well. Currently it contains:

* cpmls - list sorted directory with output similar to ls, DIR, P2DOS
	DIR and CP/M3 DIR[FULL]
* cpmcp - copy files from and to CP/M file systems
* cpmrm - erase files from CP/M file systems
* cpmchmod - change file permissions
* cpmchattr - change file attributes
* mkfs.cpm - make a CP/M file system
* fsck.cpm - check and repair a CP/M file system (only simple errors
	can be repaired so far). Some images of broken file systems
	are provided for testing.
* fsed.cpm - view CP/M file system
* manual pages for everything including the CP/M file system format
