You can find some useful scripts to create, update and drop the necessary
databases, privileges and tables in ${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/.

If you're upgrading to ${PKGNAME_NOREV} from 1.38.x or earlier, you MUST
recreate your catalog database or upgrade your old database using the
${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/update_bacula_tables script.  Later updates will
not require upgrading the database again.

The director and storage daemon systems must be upgraded simultaneously,
but you should be able to use an older file daemon with a newer director
and storage daemon if you do not use any of the new features.

Please read the full ${PKGNAME_NOREV} release notes for other important
remarks.
