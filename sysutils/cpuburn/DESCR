The cpuburn programs are designed to load x86 CPUs as heavily as
possible for the purposes of system testing.  They have been
optimized for different processors.  FPU and ALU instructions are
coded an assembler endless loop.  They do not test every instruction.
The goal has been to maximize heat production from the CPU, putting
stress on the CPU itself, cooling system, motherboard (especially
voltage regulators) and power supply (likely cause of burnBX/MMX
errors).
