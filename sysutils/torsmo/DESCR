Torsmo is a system monitor that sits in the corner of your desktop. It's
very simple, customizable and it renders only text on the desktop (and
percentagebars if you want it to ;) and the only lib it uses is Xlib.
Torsmo can show various information about your system and its peripherals,
including:

* Kernel version
* Uptime
* System time
* Network interface information
* Memory and swap usage
* Hostname
* Machine, i686 for example
* System name, Linux for example
* Temperatures from i2c-sensors
* Temperature from ACPI
* Battery capacity from ACPI/APM
* Number of processes running or sleeping
* Local mails (unread and all)
* Filesystem stats
