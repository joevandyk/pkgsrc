tdir is Yet Another Way To Display Directory Listings.  Output is in
columnar format with sub-directories listed first, and then a listing
of the files ordered by their ending "extension" - typically the
characters following the rightmost '.' in the file name (though this
can be changed on the command line).

tdir supports recursive directory examination. Total output width as
well as column width can be set on the command line and tdir will
autoformat accordingly.

tdir is written in 'python' and requires a reasonably current version
of the 'python' environment to be present on the system.
