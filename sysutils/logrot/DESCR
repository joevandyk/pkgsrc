logrot rotates log files in a safe (almost atomic) manner.
The name of the rotated file and its destination directory
are configurable. Signals may be sent to processes determined
from a pid file, or arbitrary commands may be executed upon
rotation. Optional pre-processing, compression, and post-
processing is supported.
