These tools allow you to access Macintosh disks without mounting them.
You can copy from or to BSD files, list directories, or run various
other file / directory modification commands. The command naming is
similar to that used by the mtools command (which is similar to MS-DOS
command names), except that the names begin with an 'h'.

This package installs only the traditional "Command Line Tools" from
Robert Leslie's HFS Utilities. The advanced Tcl shell and Tk GUI are
packaged independently, as the sysutils/xhfs package.
