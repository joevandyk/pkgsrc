checkpassword-pam is an implementation of checkpassword-compatible
authentication program.

checkpassword-pam was written from scratch. There are several older
packages called checkpassword-pam, derived from DJB's checkpassword
code. This checkpassword-pam is more modern and administrator-friendly.
