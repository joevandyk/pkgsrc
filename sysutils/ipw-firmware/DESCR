Firmware binary images for use with the ipw(4) driver.

Original archive is available from Intel at:
http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/firmware.php?fid=3

There are three different images:
ipw2100-1.2.fw      BSS mode (connection to an access point) firmware
ipw2100-1.2-i.fw    IBSS mode (point-to-point connection) firmware
ipw2100-1.2-p.fw    Monitor mode firmware

If you are using NetBSD < 4.0, you need the ipwctl(8) command to load
those images to your adapter.
