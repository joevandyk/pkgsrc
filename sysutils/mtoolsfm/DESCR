MToolsFM is a GTK based file-manager which gives people easy access to
MS-DOS (Windows) floppies. It uses the mtools collection of utilities
as a backend. Although originally designed for floppies, any disk
mtools works with can be accessed: Jaz, Zip, Syquest, IDE, or even
disk images.

Why MToolsFM? (Modified from the MToolsFM web-page):

  The disadvantage with mtools is that nowadays there are not many
  people who know about DOS-commands. And who would ask a UNIX newbie
  to learn DOS ;-) ? This is why you need MToolsFM: It gives you a
  simple, easy to use file-manager interface for accessing your
  floppies. It has the advantages of mtools, but you do not have to
  learn the DOS-commands.

  It is particularly helpful if you administer a NetBSD-box used by
  people who are more familiar with MS Windows. These people can now
  access floppies without the long explanation and you'll have more
  time. ;-)
