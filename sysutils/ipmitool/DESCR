Ipmitool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that support
the "Intelligent Platform Management Interface".  IPMI is an open
standard for monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of
hardware that is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS.
The service processor (or Baseboard Management Controller, BMC) is the
brain behind platform management and its primary purpose is to handle
the autonomous sensor monitoring and event logging features.

The ipmitool program provides a simple command-line interface to this
BMC. It features the ability to read the sensor data repository (SDR)
and print sensor values, display the contents of the System Event Log
(SEL), print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory information, read
and set LAN configuration parameters, and perform remote chassis power
control.
