This utility program may be used for executing several configuration
commands for the TV Out connector of ATI Rage Mobility P/M graphics
boards under GNU/Linux on x86. It is intended primarily to enable TV
Out support after bootup and for switching the used TV standard from
NTSC to PAL.

The utility makes use of x86-VESA-BIOS-calls and thus is not portable
to other architectures like PPC: *No TV-Out on Macs with this tool*.

Compatible Hardware:

  All commands:
    ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility P/M AGP 2x
        ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage LT Pro AGP-133

  detect & active:
    ATI Rage Mobility M3
