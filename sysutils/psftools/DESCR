The PSFTOOLS are designed to manipulate fixed-width bitmap fonts, such as
DOS or Linux console fonts. Both the PSF1 (8 pixels wide) and PSF2
(any width) formats are supported; the default output format is PSF2.

Note that these programs share no code with the Linux console utilities
(kbd).

NOTE: One may use the psf2txt utility to generate data for inclusion in
NetBSD's (or OpenBSD's) wscons built-in kernel font headers.  Currently,
the output requires some additional processing, but anyone who wishes
to modify psf2txt is welcome to do so.
