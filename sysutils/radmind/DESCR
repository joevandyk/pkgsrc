radmind is a suite of Unix command-line tools and a server designed
to remotely administer the file systems of multiple Unix machines.
At its core, radmind operates as a tripwire. It is able to detect
changes to any managed filesystem object, e.g. files, directories,
links, etc. However, radmind goes further than just integrity
checking: once a change is detected, radmind can optionally reverse
the change.
