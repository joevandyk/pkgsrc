sysgen reads DEC Qbus or UNIBUS device names from standard input,
assigns CSR addresses and interrupt vectors to the devices according
to the DEC standard algorithm for auto-configuration, and prints
the resulting list of allocations to standard output.

The program attempts to conform to the CONFIG command of the  VMS
SYSGEN program, but has simplified output.  Specifically, it does
not print information about VMS device naming and support.
