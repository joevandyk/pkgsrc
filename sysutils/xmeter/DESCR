Xmeter displays a periodically updating histogram of the system
statistics gathered by rstat(3) for the specified hosts.  Meters can
be displayed in a vertical, horizontal or rectangular arrangement.  As
statistics range between 4 user defineable levels (OK, WARN, ERROR or
FATAL), the background, foreground, highlight, border and internal
border colors, and the background bitmap of each meter can be changed.

Xmeter uses the StripChart widget of the Athena Widget Set to graph
each statistic.  StripCharts automatically scale the graph as the
value varies.  Each time a graph is updated, xmeter will examine the
current value of the statistic and the current scale.  As the number
of scale lines increases above wlevel and elevel the background colors
and bitmaps of each meter are modified as specified.  The current
scale value can be examined by clicking any mouse button while the
mouse pointer is in the StripChart.  If the host is down the time it's
been down will also be displayed.

Each meter has its own label displaying the host name and statistics
name.  The statistic being graphed may be modified while xmeter is
running by moving the mouse pointer into the label part of a meter,
clicking any mouse button, and sliding down to the desired stat.  This
menu also contains a quit option to exit xmeter.
