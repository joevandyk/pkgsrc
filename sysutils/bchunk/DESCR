binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes
".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.

The bin/cue format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing software, but is
not supported on most other cd-writing programs.

The .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be vnconfiged and
mounted, or written on a CD-R using cdrecord.

The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can be either
written on a CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any
other sound format for that matter) using sox.
