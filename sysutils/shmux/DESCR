shmux is program for executing the same command on many hosts in parallel.

For each target, a child process is spawned by shmux, and a shell on
the target obtained one of the supported methods: rsh, ssh, or sh. The
output produced by the children is received by shmux and either output
in turn to the user, or written to files for later processing.
