# Plugin to monitor the kernel's PLL offset for the NTP
# status.

# Usage: Link or copy into /etc/munin/node.d/
#
# Magic markers (optional - only used by munin-config and some
# installation scripts):
#
#%# family=manual
#%# capabilities=autoconf

# If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on wether we
# should be run on this system or not. This is optinal, and only used by
# munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
# always be included.
