# Plugin to monitor the number of processes on the machine. Much like
# doing a "ps | wc -l".
#
# Parameters:
#
# 	config   (required)
# 	autoconf (optional - used by munin-config)
#
# $Log: processes.in,v $
# Revision 1.1.1.1  2006/06/04 20:53:57  he
# Import the client version of the Munin system monitoring/graphing
# tool -- project homepage is at http://munin.sourceforge.net/
#
# This package has added support for NetBSD, via a number of new plugin
# scripts where specific steps needs to be taken to collect information.
#
# I also modified the ntp_ plugin script to make it possible to not
# plot the NTP poll delay, leaving just jitter and offset, which IMO
# produces a more telling graph.
#
#
#
#
# Magick markers (optional - used by munin-config and som installation
# scripts):
#%# family=auto
#%# capabilities=autoconf
